<p>Some time ago I remember trying to peek up nature's skirt,<br />
Curious and stupid as I was and should've been,<br />
And I found my mother, my aunts, my ancestors and myself<br />
All deriving from this strange and curious portal to life,<br />
And all of the poetry started to leave me...</p>
<p>So I thought less of where I came from and decided to peek </p>
