<p>Laws are good lies that function happily without Gods, Monsters or Violent acts of Parliament to enforce them;</p>
<p>However the tautology works: as revolting as the peasants are they're not revolting.</p>
<p>{<em>Men vomit into their colostomy bags, Women punch non-existent children out of their wombs, Children stair at each other with mirrors as eyes}</em></p>
<p>The author claps handcuffs on himself taking liberties with phone books dashing braincells by the dozen, saving the state hundreds of thousands: who needs the state when you can carve out your own eyes? </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Watch me now carve flesh from the eyeballs tasty doesn't it mean something to your</span></p>
<p>Audience response:</p>
