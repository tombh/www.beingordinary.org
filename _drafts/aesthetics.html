<p>You are beautiful because when you wake up you want to go to the bakery to get fresh bread;<br />
I am ugly because when I go to sleep I am angry that the fillet I cooked wasn't very good.</p>
<p>You are beautiful because you remember each day to wear eye shadow to excentuate your eyes;<br />
I am ugly because I try to defend the Liberal Party's policies and haven't been drunk.</p>
<p>You are beautiful </p>
