<p id="kont" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This post is the result of an experience.</span></span></p>
<p id="kont3" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A few weeks ago i was suddenly struck by the sheer </span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">naturalness</span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> of my self; that i am a product of nature just as a flower or a bird is. Having just read that sentance back to myself, such a realisation seems mundane, and yet, with it came a flow, an ease, which settled the tension of opposites - the war with my self - which continously rages within me. For, as nature, i am </span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">always</span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> natural, and this means that everything within me has its place, whether i judge them to be good or bad.</span></span></p>

<p id="kont31" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont33" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It became apparent to me that the usual spiritual routine - meditation, self-improvement, pursuit of peace etc - is often (though perhaps not always) an </span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">escape</span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> from nature: from what is. We are so conditioned that our heads and hearts are spilling over with should's and shouldnt's, do's and dont's, and the personal/social dilemmas which entwine them. We meditate to find peace from ourselves and the world not realising that we </span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">are</span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> the noise and the stress too - and beautifully so. Spiritual practice can then become lob-sided, we crave that peace which we only really experience whilst alone, seated in the lotus posture, counting our breaths. We become specialised, and in doing so loose the dynamic flavour of the </span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">ALL.</span></span></em></p>
<p id="kont43" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont45" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As Krishnamurti explains: 'any deliberate process of meditation is not meditation; that is so obvious. You can sit cross-legged for the rest of your life, meditate, breathe and do all that buisness, but you will not come anywhere near to that other thing. Because all that is a deliberate action to achieve a result - the cause and the effect. But the effect becomes the cause. So it is a cycle you are caught in.'</span></span><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br id="kont49" /></span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br id="kont52" /></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So, a question emerged in response to spiritual practice and the attempt to find peace:</span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br id="kont55" /></span></span><strong><em><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br id="kont61" /></span></span></em></em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Why </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">return </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">to my ground-of-being, i am </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">already </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the ground-of-being?</span></span></strong></p>
<p id="rtj42" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">I was then struck that the two implied themes of this question, becoming and being, are the essence of the occidental and oriental spiritual traditions. Indeed we can find these traits embodied in two representations which perhaps epitomise the eastern and western approach to reality: the image of the Buddha, and Rodin's sculpture-masterpiece, 'The Thinker.'</span></span></p>
<p id="m9w11" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">buddha:</span></span></p>
<p id="m9w13" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">thinker:</span></span></p>
<p id="vzyt5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The being of the buddha is timeless, it is the </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">nunc stans</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, the eternal now. The thinking of Rodin's masterpiece is concerned with linear time, the past present and future, and the conundrum of how to get from <em>here</em>, to <em>there</em>. 'We believe in <em>doing</em>' wrote Jung, 'the Indian in impassive <em>being</em>.'</span></span></p>
<p id="kont72" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont74" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">There is a fundamental reason why for the east, ideas of progress, future and betterment are often cast aside in favour of the now which is to be experienced as blissful being, void of time, self, cause and effect. For in asian metaphysical traditions such as taoism, brahmanism and buddhism (all of which have blended together) the world is viewed as ultimately <em>unreal</em>: it is a dream, an illusion of the senses (maya) or the playful dance of Shiva (lila). Neither the world, nor the personal self, has ultimate reality, and for this reason concern for progressive action in the world has been undermined by a philosophy of introspection and renunciation: the world and self is to be abandoned for the real - <em>buddha-mind, brahma, tao, nirvana, shiva</em> - which is to be found within oneself <em>as oneself</em>. Not the day-to-day self of the personality or character, but the deepest Self which is identical to the deepest reality.</span></span></p>
<p id="kont76" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont78" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Yet herein lies the paradox: being <em>is</em> becoming. Existence <em>is</em> exchange, flow, flux, nature <em>naturing</em>, evolving and yearning - the world may be a dream, but the dream is all we have. Indeed as the Buddhists say, <em>Nirvana is Samsara</em>: being and becoming are <em>One</em>. Here then, we see both thinking and being justified as equal expressions of the same unity, being needs to think in order to interpret, organise and know itself, and thought is a complex and transcendent attribute of simple being.</span></span></p>
<p id="kont80" style="text-align: left;">
<p id="kont82" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">And so, is-ness is both unmoved and moving simultaneously, which is to say it is neither one nor the other, not dual, or void, but just <em>as-it-is</em>, freely. Life is </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">being-coming-to-itself</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.</span></span></p>
<p id="n59w1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So where are we going? </span></span></p>
<p id="k:by23" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">If we accept this unity, that we <em>are</em> and yet must <em>do</em>, then the nature of this acceptance - which is to profoundly realise what we aleady are: being-thinking - will take us beyond fighting what is. For as both observer and observed simultaneously, the friction between the two is dissolved into harmony. We then see that just as a stick is one, yet has two ends, we have one nature which expresses itself as two apparent opposites.</span></span></p>
<p id="k:by27" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The attempt to curtail thinking or penetrate the mystery of being with thought has been the attempt to saw away one end of the stick in the hope of understaning the other. And yet each time we saw, we are left, again, with two ends.</span></span></p>
<p id="k:by31" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">To be, then, is to simply to do what we have been doing all along, the only difference is that we have relaxed into our essential nature whereas before we only saw a rift.</span></span></p>
<p id="wx3y1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In the end, we relinquish our <em>selves</em>. For they are not ours to claim. Nature flows on and on impersonally creating life with all of its experiences and apparent experiencers - the 'i' that exists is a kiss of nature, an expression of its mystery: it is not <em>personal</em>, not </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">me</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, or rather,</span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> I </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">am not </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">it</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.</span></span></p>
<p id="wx3y5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>This worn pot is simply clay,<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>yet within, without,<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>emptiness, overflowing space.</em></span></span></p>
<p id="wx3y13" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Ultimately we relax into our nature, realising that form is empty and emptiness is form. Then, and only then, do we actually being to live, not as an <em>idea</em>, though we still have ideas, but as <em>life itself</em>.</span></span></p>
<p id="wx3y17" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>As the breeze shapes the grass,<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>Silence creates me,<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>Yet, just as the grass would laugh aloud if it were told its name,<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>The space within </em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">this</span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>, cannot help but smile<br />
</em></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>When it  hears my name.</em></span></span></p>
<p id="fgsn37" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This is beyond knowing and not knowing, it is not 'knowledge' but that which allows it - being. Here the loop of thinking thinking thinking is put aside just as one would be free to lay aside a hammer after fixing a nail. For as Hans Vahinger said 'thought...must be regarded as a mechanism, as a machine, as an instrument in the service of life' and again, 'from the standpoint of modern epistemology we can...no longer talk about 'truth' at all, in the usual sense of the term'.</span></span></p>
<p id="xycq2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">On a similar theme to this, Pete pointed out the Socratic maxim 'all i know is nothing.' Knowledge cannot penetrate being, the source of all, and is therefore no knowledge at all - it is at best the knowledge of shadows. In this sense his call of <em>'Gnothi Seuton'</em> (know thyself) is not merely a call to amass more details about yourself, but to confront that which is the source of you - the god within - the empty-full void which breathes and acts through you. Ideed this maxim is not dry a dry philosophical concept to stroke chins at, but was inscribed above the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, Apollo being the god of the Sun which was the symbol for spiritual light and divine truth.</span></span></p>
<p id="w_xp2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Lets listen to Plato and his allegory of the Sun: </span></span></p>
<p id="w_xp8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">'The Sun, i think you will agree, not only makes the things we see visible, but causes the process of generation, growth and nourishment, without itself being such a process...The good therefore may be said to be the source not only of the intelligibility of the objects of knowledge, but also their being and reality; yet it is not itself that reality, but is beyond it, and superior to it in dignity and power'.</span></span></p>
<p id="w_xp14" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Here Plato speaks of the unity of being and knowledge, spirit and matter, and yet the ultimate transcendence of spirit from matter. For just as the sun alights upon all objects, it is also beyond all objects. In the same way, our consciousness or awareness includes all objects and knowledge and yet is ultimately uknowable in itself - it trancends all attempts to know it. As the ultimate knower, it itself cannot be known.</span></span></p>
<p id="w_xp20" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This transcendent source, this spirituall sun, is the good - yet not our mundane idea of good, but a transcendent good, that when realised is experienced as sat-chit-ananda, 'being-consciousness-bliss'.</span></span></p>
