<p>Bless this breath,<br />
I remembered it.</p>
<p>I guess it is literally one in ten million that I've had that makes this one so approximately special.</p>
<p>I'm not in the counting business, so I guess I best tell you about two things that I heard about from where I am from.</p>
<p>The first is an imagined story that I made up myself about the local tribes that I told to a bunch of people once when I was drunk. It was about a snake, who hid away from all of the other snakes and would take the children away. This snake got so big and fat that when the locals found him he couldn't slither away, and so they caught him and all of the children came back out.</p>
<p>The second is the apology granted by the new Government of Australia towards the original ancestors and inhabitants of the land now called Australia. I, myself, missed it. Actually, still, I haven't read it. Completely forgot, didn't know, couldn't know, hurt afterward thinking I was doing something more productive with my time...</p>
<p>I'd apologised years ago... </p>
<p>It actually shocked me to discover that the two stories were both false for the same reason.</p>
<p>One was that I invented someone elses myth to expose someone elses indifference to a culture they hadn't met - ie. I invented one to attempt to be insightful about something that has been long considered the most harmful cultural crime someone can commit.</p>
<p>The second was this idea that a representive body could even attempt such a cultural anomoly after centuries of ignorance and indifference and denial to think that a simple day alone could cure such a rift...</p>
<p>In both cases, I'm happy to admit that I am wrong. </p>
<p>But my wrongs don't make a right. </p>
<p>They don't amount to very much at all...</p>
<p>Maybe my carbon guilt will catch up with me soon enough...</p>
