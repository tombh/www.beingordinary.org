<h2><font face="Arial">            I song with sun</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
<p>Words wisp across my open sky while</p>
<p>Leaves dance in autumn twists and plastic bags.</p>
<p>A tall skyscraper of city apartments: </p>
<p>On top floor, a concrete hurry next to ocean soar. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I stand on my head, feet sipping nothingness, </p>
<p>Mouth relaxed, skin gentle. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Fond saliva has no form; </p>
<p>I dribble and pass it by, </p>
<p>Opening emptiness as I fly</p>
<p>My world in to a frozen concrete sky. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Saliva joins the ocean as I smile </p>
<p>Along the curve of rushing air: </p>
<p>I splash in the gravity of your home. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">I empty, dance till my feet are thread, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Spin till my head flows as ink. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Summer leaves and winter falls, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Joyous notes curling in a gnarl of thread. </font></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I float without a warning; </p>
<p>I warm gold in the morning.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I dawn with the scent of a wink, </p>
<p>A flash of colour in a smile, and speak to you; </p>
<p>I spring, weaving myself about your legs, </p>
<p>Trickling across stony parts; </p>
<p>I roll carpets, spun skies of embroidered ocean, </p>
<p>A babble of drifting creeks; </p>
<p>I cloud inside a broken smile, </p>
<p>Patter you a rain of leaf and feeling. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I sing my coils.</p>
<p>I dance my soul. </p>
<p>I lean my ease. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I slough and shed runaway feet; </p>
<p>I tread with garden in welcome pace. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My right hand is my left hand,</p>
<p>My left hand is my right hand;</p>
<p>A green spread of fingers,</p>
<p>It wreathes and lingers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I celebrate the we self.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I nature for trees; I height for mountains.</p>
<p>I wet for oceans; I vast for skies.</p>
<p>I welkin as earth; I earth for creatures.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I creature my heart.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I trace with feather and flex of ambushing paw,</p>
<p>Twitch the tang of grass on the pink of a nose,</p>
<p>Glide a tail in pleasing circles, </p>
<p>Eddy the wink of dewy grass, </p>
<p>Ruffle a downy breath</p>
<p>And crop plantations: </p>
<p>Corn among the tufts of an ear, </p>
<p>Bananas sprouting along curved fingers,</p>
<p>Cotton groving in the fluff of flight.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I length a feline sharp to peel rich sugars,</p>
<p>Feed breezing currents the ring of happy bells.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I invite the rose to plume on a bee’s wing, </p>
<p>Tweet the mottle of honeying plenty, </p>
<p>Garden the legs bowing with rainbow sacks. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A cat leaps and a bird takes flight. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I lie in grass, dying.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I forget who I am.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>An abundance of textures: </p>
<p>I shatter on the vision before me.                       </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Identity bleeds.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A griffin walks across a grave.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Diaphanous sheets of me rustle foldings of liquid,</p>
<p>Lean with the seep of drinking fronds.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Slumbering in a strange breath,</p>
<p>I join a nymph of melody</p>
<p>As she swims the oasis of my depths.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I trill with the giggle of slender ankles,</p>
<p>Trestle a home inside the sparkle of silvered gaze,</p>
<p>Flutter my rhythms along the curling of her toes,</p>
<p>The flax of her luxuriant kick,</p>
<p>The daint of her hair.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Always losing myself, fracturing inside the Imaginary. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The piping of flutes lap against my shore,</p>
<p>Tide to the pound of frantic dancing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Muscular feet stamp a rattle through my soul,</p>
<p>Storm clouds of dust, </p>
<p>Thicken thunder, </p>
<p>Grind a rattle along my throat.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The breaking of my soul reaches for a voice.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Inside oceans of feeling,</p>
<p>Geysers of knowledge, </p>
<p>Trenches of memory,</p>
<p>I can only hiss and shriek,</p>
<p>Lost in the splendour of my learning,</p>
<p>Imprisoned in footprints</p>
<p>Librarying a citadel of blood.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am left me all alone.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I walk and know not where.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I exist and know not how.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I imagine and know not why.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I know and feel not what.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Pouring myself in to the past,</p>
<p>Filtering me through a mould,</p>
<p>I stream across my grave,</p>
<p>Rivulet in the moistures of dead soil,</p>
<p>Kiln the vessel contained within,</p>
<p>Clay my essence without a tongue to spake.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hunger as the Earth names me Monster.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My spine arcs the tension of final moments, </p>
<p>Curves the thunders that roar inside my drowning heart;</p>
<p>Arms splayed on the heaven’s anvil, </p>
<p>Sky rips from my breaking lips an eagle’s cry. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I take wing;</p>
<p>I flee the bloodying earth.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I rush midnight under the might of my feather spread;</p>
<p>I scorch toward the sun.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Feathers peel raw in the flay of the wind’s kiss, </p>
<p>Bones break inside the caress of clouds, </p>
<p>Air bleeds upon my eye.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The heavens cast me down, pinioned and transformed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I tear as the Sky names me Unwanted.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A broken leopard lying on its side,</p>
<p>Fur matted in clumps of disease; </p>
<p>I trickle my blood and twist, motionless, </p>
<p>With internal pain – the Sky eats me from within.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Once more, I try to speak to you: </p>
<p>The earth spears me with blades of grass, </p>
<p>Wreaks a roughness on my tongue,</p>
<p>Summers a plough of bladed hooves.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A feeble cry, </p>
<p>A mewling puddle of cat saliva,</p>
<p>A heavy-lidded meow. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hurtful blows – the seasons roll on.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Life forges me,</p>
<p>Hurts me to make me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Feline slits cinder beneath the sun. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I refuse to turn aside my gaze;</p>
<p>I burn my sight to the socket.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I make me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I bruise as Death names me You.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>I surge, </p>
<p>I rouse,</p>
<p>I rise my untameable, </p>
<p>I quest my enormity, </p>
<p>I cyclone my titanic love.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Against the strongest bonds of history, </p>
<p>The most certain restrictions of men,</p>
<p>The inevitability of rule,</p>
<p>The voice of the Fathers,</p>
<p>I chorus the wild of my veins. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I celebrate my blood.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I coil them in spools,</p>
<p>Pendent my vitality in colour,</p>
<p>Embed myself as iron diamonds,</p>
<p>Glitter my majesty in black oceans,</p>
<p>Law with all that I am.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am Unbound.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Nothing can stop the blood of me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The world celebrates my strength.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Maybe you can hear me red as I glow;</p>
<p>Maybe you can hear me emblem my breast.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I journey me through the Labyrinth,</p>
<p>A threaded way; </p>
<p>I skein upon my feet,</p>
<p>I glore with my opening thread.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I full my felt cloth, </p>
<p>Drape raiments in hidden places,</p>
<p>Ribbon the spider’s corner.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I home with sparrows,</p>
<p>Den with wolves,</p>
<p>Pride with lions, </p>
<p>Clicker with crickets,</p>
<p>Nest with hurt,</p>
<p>Time with age.</p>
<p>Lair with truth.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do all these things and more.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am not poetry for hard times;</p>
<p>I am poetry for all times.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I never sparse:</p>
<p>I love you too much.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I welcome even monsters.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I cradle sapphires, </p>
<p>Ruby lips, </p>
<p>Emerald leaves,</p>
<p>Diamond ears.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do not mine the rocks; </p>
<p>I pass over everything in peace.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My breath is treasure enough;</p>
<p>My lungs vein the earth with wealth. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The rock mines me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There is so much of me;</p>
<p>I give myself in handfuls.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Abundant is me;</p>
<p>I hold nothing back.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I gaggle with the geese overhead;</p>
<p>I busy with the ants underfoot;</p>
<p>I tuck with the slumbering ducks;</p>
<p>I bow with the splendid light;</p>
<p>I leaf with the dancing foliage;</p>
<p>I toil with the eager dirt;</p>
<p>I moon with the rhythms;</p>
<p>I hive with the stars;</p>
<p>I dust with the honey;</p>
<p>I warble with the philosopher;</p>
<p>I weave with the bark;</p>
<p>I silly with the saints;</p>
<p>I smoke with the warmth;</p>
<p>I lope with the wolf;</p>
<p>I combobulate with the cloud;</p>
<p>I mist with the grass;</p>
<p>I seat with the standing gulls;</p>
<p>I mound with the dunes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My genius is the glory of the sun.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All values glitter on me, deep-spun on my looming soul.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Flowing golden leafs of me,</p>
<p>Pages and pages of me,</p>
<p>I gentle in the palm of your hand,</p>
<p>Tower health in ruined cottages,</p>
<p>Moss blessings in cracking mortar,</p>
<p>Spray volumes in the knell of dry wells.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am for whom the bell tolls.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I lightning you my depths,</p>
<p>Crackle the arcs of my sway,</p>
<p>Glass the sandy heaths.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I in turn toll for you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I unchamber you from the hour,</p>
<p>Soar the dapple of your deserts,</p>
<p>Depart the haste of your camels,</p>
<p>Child you the marvel of my eye.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I refract with you,</p>
<p>Expand your flow.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I prism delights upon the shade.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I melt your essence,</p>
<p>Teach the tears to flow. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I clothe time around your sole;</p>
<p>I splash me in your glistening soul.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I teach the slow of time,</p>
<p>My smile of we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I quiet stalking darkness,</p>
<p>Free grains of sand,</p>
<p>Unshutter frowning curtains,</p>
<p>Coo silks of midnight,</p>
<p>Hoot a gliding embrace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I enter the blank of the Bull’s eye.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have found myself:</p>
<p>I know I am real.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Everywhere I dance:</p>
<p>Always with you,</p>
<p>For you,</p>
<p>As you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I teach the dance.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You do not awkward.</p>
<p>Even when you stumble,</p>
<p>You are beautiful.</p>
<p>You can only grace.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I share my beauty.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To receive me is to be beautiful;</p>
<p>To not receive me is to destroy me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I love how you dance:</p>
<p>The play of feet,</p>
<p>The wish of air,</p>
<p>The small of a back,</p>
<p>The stream of hair.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You texture so wonderful.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I look the sky to shape upon the earth, </p>
<p>Comb the shag of its garden,</p>
<p>The still of its ocean,</p>
<p>Through ripples of my feeling, </p>
<p>Tensing a blanket from </p>
<p>Whitest threads, bluest dyes, </p>
<p>On billows of wind.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I laugh away despairing gusts </p>
<p>To spread the contours </p>
<p>I hurl and laze.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I swell my big;</p>
<p>I tangle my small.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I glory.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No pain is too much.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I spasm my hand and gather you in the grass at dawn;</p>
<p>Shocks of bundled gold veil stubbles of green.</p>
<p>I rope all inside my blood and saliva, </p>
<p>Stain across the Sky and loam within the Earth.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All of this hurts.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Nothing diminishes my welcome.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As I lie dying, I smell you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My nostrils smile in delight,</p>
<p>Frolic their hairs in greeting.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You scent me too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Cascading a fountain of shaggy beard, </p>
<p>Blooming the wealth of crinkling eyes,</p>
<p>Snowing kind whiskers down a weathered rough,</p>
<p>I raise ancient mountains, </p>
<p>Clap rivers between my hands,</p>
<p>Rest my tender feet on the curve of a mountainous cheek.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I bubble galaxies of laughter;</p>
<p>My heart names me Everything.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am very old and very young;</p>
<p>I was born out of time and in time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Red sand creaks.</p>
<p>Jagged faith stares.</p>
<p>A saint despairs his Damascus. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hush: you too are an apostle.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I heal even murderers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Peace, brother.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Peace, sister.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Beating to the rhythm of internal splendour, </p>
<p>I gush whistles of blood – </p>
<p>Eagle, lion, leopard, cat, owl, griffin, </p>
<p>Titan, nymph, satyr, minotaur, </p>
<p>Horse, god, human, sparrow, All – </p>
<p>Humming the shapes </p>
<p>That moan for acceptance, </p>
<p>Vortex within their own fragility.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am Poet and shear with awful plenty.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I strength for you. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I dance for you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I cosmos for you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All that I am sings to you, accepts you and is you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I fleece with might,</p>
<p>Press the broken tower </p>
<p>Against my golden bell; </p>
<p>So soft I tint me in your tears,</p>
<p>Friend kisses of me beneath distressed lashes,</p>
<p>Empty age from weary bones.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I joy in the wonder of your eye,</p>
<p>Delicate my thumb on your sorrows.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The lines of my finger guide furrows,</p>
<p>Direct salts return to the great sea,</p>
<p>Tremble empathy on your petals.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I never plough;</p>
<p>I love my green.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I allow you to plough me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No pain is too much.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am convalescence;</p>
<p>I am health and good strength to you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I glade my soul;</p>
<p>I invite pasture.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I clear my throat, </p>
<p>Vibrate the string of your harp;</p>
<p>I echo my vocal chords across Time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Everyone shall hear me;</p>
<p>None can evade me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do not try to evade you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You are magnificent.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I sound long and pure.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My medium is wonder;</p>
<p>I can only hum near you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I mosaic the broken, </p>
<p>Texture the smile of jagged glass.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I turn toward the worst,</p>
<p>Knowing they are the best.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I shout a startle of hummingbirds,</p>
<p>Feather the perfection of imperfection. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I stand.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am broad at the shoulders.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Many things stand with me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I live with you.</p>
<p>I remember you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am beautiful.</p>
<p>You are beautiful too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You recognise genius.</p>
<p>It is my smile.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Raining my sunbeams,</p>
<p>I warm the me that fears the storm,</p>
<p>Communicate you to the me that dreams</p>
<p>A we outside a tide of red lawn, </p>
<p>And cleft your lip to remind a tender sound.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My ‘yea’, an imaginary touch of real feeling,</p>
<p>Reaches, moon-beaming, across the summer dust.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My yea on the wind, I say, </p>
<p>My yea that dances with bees.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Echoing so broken,</p>
<p>No one hears me dying</p>
<p>As I speak to you </p>
<p>With braids of air. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I vibrate a shiver of flower motes,</p>
<p>Perfume along your spine.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am always dying and always living.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I silent as I name myself to you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And this is as it should be.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hunger for food.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I tear for joy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I bruise for warmth.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I silent for song.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do all of this for you;</p>
<p>I have so many gifts for you,</p>
<p>Many, many mes for you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>One of these mes is you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I steam with the minotaur,</p>
<p>Vapour blood and stink,</p>
<p>Lick a maze of wounds.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I fall with the rain,</p>
<p>Yield my happiness in glory,</p>
<p>Shout greetings to the ocean.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I decay with the leaves,</p>
<p>Detritus for tomorrow,</p>
<p>Spread my ancient lace.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I wind with the bees, </p>
<p>Gust golden notes of pollen,</p>
<p>Sound wonder in silence.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I celebrate my we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I join you there so you can join we here;</p>
<p>I breathe my we and loaf to teach my slow.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I kiss slumbering feet and float the petal.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sweetest of lies budding anew:</p>
<p>I sun on you, flower we true.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I invite breath;</p>
<p>I gesture soul.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I bubble tomorrow; </p>
<p>I soap yesterday.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I ring Earth; </p>
<p>I glory Now. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I halo my hello;</p>
<p>I world the we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I dribble you a home inside the soil of my song.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I welcome as leaf, trail a gnarled perfume </p>
<p>Along the bark of a beach-playing Shepherd.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I laugh my shaggy hair; I brush my bristled earth.</p>
<p>I sand my car; I pant my tongue. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Never doubt I am welcoming you;</p>
<p>I await you everywhere,</p>
<p>Greet you always.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This too is me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Am I not beautiful?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I depart but never leave;</p>
<p>I walk but never move.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I wake my night;</p>
<p>I birth my glow.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I leap, flying beyond bound of metal machine;</p>
<p>I court, sharing beyond bound with green on blue.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I sprig and palm flowers.</p>
<p>I skim and seat waterfalls.</p>
<p>I tilt and blow stars.</p>
<p>I jag and bend rainbows.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Everything twice and never: never me always.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p>I touch eternity.</p>
<p>I grass.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch invisibility.</p>
<p>I cloud.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch humanity.</p>
<p>I moon.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch mortality.<br />
I wolf.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch language.<br />
I leaf.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch you.<br />
I bee.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I touch me.</p>
<p>I we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We are we. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Invisible I sight. </p>
<p>Silent I hear. </p>
<p>Alone I touch. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We are we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Are we not beautiful says me?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I waft and ask: Do me understand this we?</p>
<p>I purr and ask: Do me feel this we?</p>
<p>I pad and ask: Do me know this we?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Everything asks about we;</p>
<p>We is the answer to me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The we of my whole cares for each me. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I die for this we; </p>
<p>I birth for this we.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I green with sun.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I Earth my One.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I music with tree.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I song my we.</p></p></p>
