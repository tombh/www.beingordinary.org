<p><em>Being Ordinary</em> is a website created by two friends, Tom and Mike, and is dedicated to the expression and exploration of what it truly means to be a human being. Ideas such as Enlightenment, Awakening or Self-Realisation, often serve to distract us from the ordinary and mundane from which we assume we must  escape or transcend. Yet if seen clearly, simple and directly, the ordinary can lead us into total acceptance and end the search for something ‘extra’.</p>
<p>These podcasts are the result of many discussions over many years  and although the essence of what is presented here does not require words, labels or theory, the sheer enjoyment and creativity of speaking about the wordless has led to these recorded discussions. We hope that whatever is expressed here directs you straight to the heart of the vast silence from which all expression arises.</p>
<p><em>Being Ordinary</em> is a natural evolution of an earlier website we created called <em>Sheer Uncanniness, </em>which acted as a forum for discussion about the fundamental nature of being. The posts (including many excellent poems) are still available here through the archives.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">About Tom...</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">I first got into spirituality in 2001 after reading the book <em>Mindfulness: The Path to the Deathless</em> by Ajahn Sumedho. Meditation has done me a lot of good over the years, I'd highly recommend it. I first met Mike in the students union at Lampeter University where we were studying Religious Studies, he looked like a bit of a hippy and I just thought we'd get on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nowadays I'm<a href="http://www.tombh.co.uk/" target="_blank"> making websites</a> and loving open source software and the open social web. You might like to read my book about spirituality and stuff, <a href="http://www.tombh.co.uk/ive-written-a-book/" target="_blank">The Last Beyond</a>. I am <a href="http://twitter.com/twombh" target="_blank">@twombh</a> on Twitter.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">About Mike...</span></h3>
<p>Born on the Isle of Man I was brought up around Therevadin Buddhism by my Father who ordained as a monk (you can visit his website at <a href="http://www.puredhamma.org/" target="_blank">PureDhamma.org</a>). After various travels in India and Asia I took a degree in Religious Studies at Lampeter in Wales, where I met Tom who was playing banjo and singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. After years of serious seeking, I met teachers such as Ramesh Balsekar, Tony Parsons and Mooji who transformed my understanding of  spirituality. I've also completed a Masters Degree in Western Esotericism and a diploma in Meditation, Mindfulness and Relaxation.</p>
<p>I now teach Mindfulness Meditation, write poems and give talks on Nonduality. My website is <a href="http://www.myfreemind.im/">www.myfreemind.im</a>.  Chat to me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MyFreeMind_IOM" target="_blank">@MyFreeMind_IOM</a>.</p>
