<p>I would be interested to know what you think of this picture. </p>
<p>I put it together slowly, collaging different images that reflected systems of thought, different attempts to explain our existential questions. </p>
<p>One of the qualities of our present age is scientific thinking. The ecological relationships we are now aware of through scientific thinking could be said to parallel the relationships people once formulated in astrology. Both point to intimate links between us and the universe we find ourselves in, and perhaps answer an existential need to find our place. </p>
<p>For me the picture evokes the reflex in humans to theorize and venerate those ideas,and the grey figure, the poignancy of needing to know, perhaps, the unanswerable. The bright colours may make the image kitsch and superficial, but somehow that for me was important. Perhaps so it wouldn't be too serious an image- to engender play with colour and with the dripping of the paint. </p>
<p>I do not think of it as a very refined piece of art, but I thought it was interesting and might provoke some questions.  </p>
<p>Some of those questions for me are: What are the limits of our theories? In scientific thinking can we actually objectively know? But even more- where does this reflex to want to understand our place in the world come from? I think it is rather curious but lovely that we do! </p>
<p>In materialistic terms it could be said we are biological creatures that are ourselves a whole host of interlinked processes that span the divide of what we tend to call ourself and not ourself (the air we breathe that becomes part of our structure, the bacteria that make up most of the cells in our body, let alone every cell probably being the result of archaic symbiotic relationships between bacteria, and the way the matter that we are is in transfer from and to other organisms). We are a symptom of causality like any other animal  (a very complex method of conserving a particular patterns of DNA?). Yet I have the wierd ability to determine the edges of what I call 'myself' then ask 'myself' what is my life about? Who am I? No wonder there is an existential paradox, if 'me' is an unstable changing collection of matter in communion with the matter of the universe! Anyway enough of my ramblings. I would like end with a more joyful response to this theme from Rabindranath Tagore: </p>
<p>"The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.</p>
<p>It is the same life that shoots joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and death, in ebb and flow.</p>
<p>I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment."</p>
