<p>In this video I talk about the appeal psychotherapy has for me. I've been both training to become a psychotherapist and been receiving one-to-one therapy for the last year. It's been interesting meeting psychotherapy from my meditative background, there's certainly a significant overlap between the two approaches, but they also differ. The common thread for me is the encouragement of returning to look at one's immediate experience with fresh eyes.</p>
