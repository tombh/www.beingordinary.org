<p>Tom speaks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/valkyira" target="_blank">Kyira Korrigan</a>, a dharma teacher in the lineage of <a href="http://www.dharmapunx.com/" target="_blank">Noah Levine</a>. The discussion focuses around the thorny subject of gender equality in traditional Buddhist institutions. The recording jumps straight into an out-of-context reference to the <a href="http://www.garrisoninstitute.org/index.php?option=com_civicrm&amp;task=civicrm/event/info&amp;reset=1&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=998" target="_blank">Garrsion Teacher's Council</a> (a multi-tradition meeting of 230 Buddhist teachers from the West), so bear that in mind when you begin listening. It was recorded in Los Angeles during the Buddhist Geeks conference in July.</p>
