<p>Today is the spring equinox and Sheer Uncanniness is back up and running.</p>
<p>It was down because the computer in the basement upon which it was living got unplugged by my Landlord and before I had time to fix it I had moved house. The website is now running on a proper, commercially managed webserver somewhere in the UK, that host computer will also accomadate many other websites, so it's a lot more social for poor lonely websites, because they can all get together in the evenings and chat the kind of stuff websites chat about.</p>
<p>So where were we?</p>
<p>The great matter of life and death. I still have no idea what's really going on. Do you?</p>
