<p>Breathing heavy in the masks of smiles and strengths<br />
Saving the sighs and screams for the empty mountains and skies<br />
Polite company deserves merely polite asides<br />
While cowering in sweat-soaked sheets each night</p>
<p>Call in the brain shrink-wrapped sense of material anguish<br />
Every existential crisis needs but an audience of one<br />
A beached wail is all one can muster out of a<br />
Splendid coughing of inward recoiling and bored musings:</p>
<p>Save the tears, phlegm, blood and bile for the ice age<br />
No humours here, nor hypocracy either<br />
Store up your apathy and cynicism<br />
Your pathologist may need to take a reading sooner than you think</p>
<p>Why so frail? I beg, speak your ills and purge them;<br />
This body, meek and mild it may seem has not yet seen through<br />
Lesser conquests that plagues, wars, famines and climbed<br />
Higher regions than thought ever possible...</p>
<p>Yet you choose to fall as if you've never learned to walk<br />
Saying 'no' 'never' 'can't' as soon as you learned to talk<br />
Of all the things you've learned and learned you could achieve<br />
You've learned to balk and forgotten that you breath. </p>
