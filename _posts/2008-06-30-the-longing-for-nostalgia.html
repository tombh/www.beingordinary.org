<p>Zarathrustra sat longing in his trembling iceburg mountain chamber,<br />
Change clamouring from moment to monumental moment,<br />
Between states of legs all a kimble and foetal numbness,<br />
The panorama of humanity at his grasp, he tumbled out the phrase -</p>
<p>"Why would a creator make us suffer so?"</p>
<p>In that instant the ice thawed, the heavens parted and a new dawn of man was born.</p>
<p>The majesty of the man who accepts his suffering as his birthright<br />
Came forth and claimed that was rightfully his - life. </p>
<p>And thus Zarathrustra fell again to earth,<br />
Wings clipped in states of bliss and folly<br />
With legs all a kimble and terrified foetal mutiny,<br />
In praise of man - with God's severed head tucked neatly under one arm,<br />
Longing desperately for the past, nostaligic for the future,<br />
And humbled by the "is". </p>
