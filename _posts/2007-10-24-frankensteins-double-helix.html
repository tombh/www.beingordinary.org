<p>I am the monster.<br />
I am the celebrity.<br />
What harsh beast have I created,<br />
What love can I expect from such an abomination?<br />
How can I turn these eyes to greater deeds?</p>
<p>The limitations of Darwin are facinating –<br />
The descriptions of skins and sex and gender,<br />
Are to be meaured with our primative tools of<br />
Reason, Justice and Commerce.</p>
<p>Still primates, we set about our beliefs,<br />
In Science, Mathematics, Gods and Law,<br />
But the black holes suck upon our Science like leaches,<br />
Infinitities suck upon our absolutes like Deities,<br />
Doubt paws upon our Gods as they paw away at us,<br />
And our Laws, our poor Laws try to convict us of our natures<br />
And make us lepers to words that the few read and rarely practice.</p>
<p>May our ancestors beat us with rocks and stones,<br />
Our words our nature our debate our crisis,<br />
Is of no concern to our planet –<br />
We’re guests, at best, and we can save the planet,<br />
But we cannot save ourselves.</p>
<p>Leave an entrail at least, my friends,<br />
Let the blood and tears that we soak be a joy to the Earth,<br />
Take my limbs my arms my organs for what utility<br />
They may serve as limbs arms arteries<br />
Forests lakes mountains and vapours<br />
But my soul will not haunt you –</p>
<p>You’ve your own soul to haunt you…</p>
