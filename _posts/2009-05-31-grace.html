<p>Reading those words,<br />
Something inside me snapped like a twig.</p>
<p>Suddenly grace descended and the veil evaporated<br />
Leaving only radiant life in which I was merged and drowned.</p>
<p>Feeling like a child in a garden paradise<br />
Like a happy animal wondering at the deep silent Now</p>
<p>Time fell away and I gazed at the flowers for eternity.</p>
<p>In love with everything<br />
Laughing at the obvious,</p>
<p>Which for 29 years had been so clear</p>
<p>That I was blind to it.</p>
