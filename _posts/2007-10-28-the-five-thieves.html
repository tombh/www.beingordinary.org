<p>Unabashed bastardry – someone stole away my libido,<br />
Taking away my balls and shoving them into a purse,<br />
Leaving me flat, deserted, fragile and flaccid;<br />
So I gave away my misery – a charitable deed done,<br />
My being no longer troubled by the consummation of flesh,<br />
I plucked myself off the rack of pleasure and strode briskly along.</p>
<p>Before long, I realised I’d forgotten my appetite, or worse<br />
Left it at the last inn with my credit card.<br />
Damned luck, I no longer hungered to fill the void<br />
Between my esophageus and my bowels;<br />
I could no maintain my ambition to swallow the world<br />
As I marched merrily along to my next source of bad fortune.</p>
<p>The wretched wheel of fate next beat me over the head,<br />
Sucking at the deep vein thrombosis in my neck<br />
Until my anger had been spilt upon the footpath;<br />
O shallow waters of humility was all they left me with,<br />
My hideous contentment overcoming me like a rash;<br />
But I was running late so I moved towards my next fatal blow.</p>
<p>In the darkness I stumbled across a beauteous mirror<br />
That would’ve given Narcissus reason to leave his pond<br />
To gaze upon the wonderful image I had found in it;<br />
But some incredible moron came along and smashed it<br />
With his clumsy hands, and my pride ran swiftly off into the distance,<br />
Never to be seen again. Weakly, meekly, I trundled onwards.</p>
<p>My journey ended when I found a little bird, full of softness,<br />
Kindness and more love than could be stung from a single kiss<br />
Than all of the riches of the world combined;<br />
But the winds of time swept her away to foreign shores,<br />
Leaving me longing to catch that little bird<br />
To hold it in my grasp just one last time…</p>
<p>But I looked back over my journey and counted my losses,<br />
My balls, my hunger, my anger, my mirror;<br />
But no loss was as great as the seas of sadness left by her departing,<br />
Leaving me with my love of her with nowhere to put it.<br />
I try endlessly to  throw my love away but I keep finding it,<br />
The little bird stole my heart but my left my love tied to my shoe.</p>
<p>So come on, little pest, let us trundle forward to find new places<br />
To cast you off – how many times have I tried to rid you of my presence<br />
Only to have you come back to me each time more hopeful than the last;<br />
Is there no thief coy enough, no bandit strong enough,<br />
To take you from me once and for all –<br />
My love just won’t leave me alone no matter how far I fall.</p>
