<p>Fragility is the key interest of the boxer -<br />
Why do we break?</p>
<p>Losing the simple mask of consumer/consumed,<br />
What remembrance other than violence<br />
Do we seek?<br />
Violence is the brittle witchcraft of the ages...<br />
The most effective agent to cure the things that we don't want to cope with.</p>
<p>I saw a child tonight tear the head of a doll. She laughed. </p>
<p>All I could think of was why a doll-maker would enable a two-year old to remove the head so easily...</p>
<p>And so I thought a little bit Christian for a while... and asked...</p>
<p>God, why did you design death?</p>
<p>And then I got bored, and figured that god wasn't going to answer. That I'd have to read. That the entire game was rigged to those that read. </p>
<p>I'm not sure whether I've meant this to be funny or not. I'm not...</p>
<p>Sure...</p>
<p>Does this pause... I mean (...) mean pause? This means time? Or is time just - you know           space               between spaces....           .            does time stop when spaces kinda              maxicate? Is, er, maxicate a word... mayevbe i should check my messages... </p>
