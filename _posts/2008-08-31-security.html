<p>A bad design, the human atomaton;<br />
Too many flaws, too many failings,<br />
Boredom being the most prominent,<br />
Followed sharply by the lusts and hungers.</p>
<p>Why argue evolution when the opposite is obvious?<br />
Death, the bringer of truth, more prominant than any muse,<br />
All pursuits being trivial, one need only stare<br />
Recklessly at the anatomy<br />
And cry out pointlessly - </p>
<p>Why leave the heart guarded thus?</p>
<p>Sentinels, battalions, armies, mercenaries, atom bombs,<br />
Gods, miracles, states, titles, religions, epoch upon apogees<br />
Only to leave us with a few bones and tissue to protect our rhythms?</p>
<p>The greatest war ever fought was for the heart -<br />
Helen, scrumpet you, tear another tear in this ceremony<br />
Of butchery - limbs and ideals must be cast astray<br />
For all that bares good fruit these days is the heart...</p>
<p>Pluck a few ribs away and its yours.<br />
All it takes is a little concentration.<br />
Take the heart, leave the stuffing,<br />
And bring forth new wares for the brewing.</p>
