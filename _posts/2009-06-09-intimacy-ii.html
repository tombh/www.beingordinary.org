<p> </p>
<p>Being myself</p>
<p>Was easier than I thought.</p>
<p>With thought, without  thought,  I am</p>
<p>As I had always been.</p>
<p>What beauty, what sheer intimacy</p>
<p>Lies in a seagull's shreik,</p>
<p>A sip of tea, a mere scratch of the head.</p>
<p>What use are miracles</p>
<p>When all is miracle?</p>
<p>What use is there in practice?</p>
<p>When you have always been the goal.</p>
<p>Shhh, how perfect!</p>
<p>The cars roll by,</p>
<p>trees sway in the breeze.</p>
