<p>The words soften the doom on the occasion,<br />
Don’t they?<br />
The memories are often wonderful and terrible<br />
Within the twitch?</p>
<p>There aren’t any REAL questions worth asking,<br />
Are there?</p>
<p>No matter or grievance or pretence or possibility<br />
Is worth as much as…</p>
<p>WHAT?<br />
WHERE?<br />
WHY?<br />
WHO?<br />
WHICH?<br />
HOW?<br />
WHEN?</p>
<p>The when is how,<br />
The why is who,<br />
The ‘is’ is where,<br />
The what is ‘how’ing</p>
<p>The which is what,<br />
The who is why,<br />
The how is THAT<br />
The what is ‘witching’ (whiching)</p>
<p>The when is THEN<br />
The how is HOW<br />
The why is SO<br />
The where is THERE</p>
<p>The game is on<br />
The rhyme is tied<br />
The moment has gone<br />
But don’t fear…</p>
<p>The thickening will come upon you<br />
No abstraction here,<br />
No questions to hide behind,<br />
No answers that hinder fear…</p>
<p>Whoops, such a shame –</p>
<p>Such eloquent thoughts,<br />
And yet the rhyme ruins the reason.</p>
