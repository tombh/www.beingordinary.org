<p>It can all change.</p>
<p>Anything can happen. What you so unquestioningly take for granted today could be gone tomorrow. Whether it's something you cherish; a nice house, well-paid work or a consoling spiritual ideal, it could be swept from under your feet without a hint of remorse from the universe.</p>
<p>Though, of course, it could be something you disdain; a noisy neighbour, an achy back or a fog of depression, they can vanish as easily as they appeared.</p>
<p>If you remember this then you are truly welathy.</p>
