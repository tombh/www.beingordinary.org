<p>If being good is good enough then what, say you, is good enough?<br />
Turning up, being there, knowing you care, lifting objects, doing...<br />
If it is pleasurable, giving, teaching, caring, releaving;<br />
How do we understand those that don't give, teach, care, reveal?</p>
<p>Is our understanding of those that don't give, teach, care, reveal<br />
The very problem of how we understand the good?<br />
Are our forgivings foregoing the understanding altogether?<br />
To give before the lack of giving - to pre-give - </p>
<p>Is that our nature?</p>
<p>Hiding, hoarding, whoring, valuing, measuring, timing...<br />
Certainly they are, but are they good? Is giving a value?<br />
Can it be measured, does it have material purpose,<br />
Is it important, can it cause us pain?</p>
<p>This can't be a poem, can it, it is just plain childish confusion<br />
That we can never answer to a child even in a whisper,<br />
Children understand that life is certainly not enough,<br />
But it'll do for now.</p>
