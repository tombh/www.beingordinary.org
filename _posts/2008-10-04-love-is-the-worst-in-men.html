<p>To the terrible and just authors of iniquity,</p>
<p>Tides, fruits, ideals,<br />
Webbing masterfully and majestically<br />
In their puritanical whims of deceit<br />
Descent upon us willingly or no,<br />
Defty decantering our poor withered souls<br />
Without delay;</p>
<p>Swift justice is given to those that love<br />
Beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Sitting, purposely removed from sight<br />
I dovetail each and every night<br />
Whether the news be good or bad –<br />
Bad poetry being the simple cure for my ails<br />
The good drink a bad disenchanted ailment<br />
Of my proxy give me a more retched existence<br />
To complain of – these meek and mild whims<br />
Amuse noone save oneself for more triumphant<br />
Tunes and revel in nothing less than<br />
Trivial backwardness. </p>
<p>This is an unweeded garden filled with good hopes<br />
And intentions and should be mused over by the gardener<br />
Alone.<br />
Casting abuse at the skies is little more than a strange derth<br />
Of anger;<br />
Intigers have evaded your poor grasp on the unendedness of<br />
Strife;<br />
Cut these new sour ribbons of poetic indifference with sharp<br />
Slashings;<br />
They lead you towards the worst in men – not death, not history,<br />
Not destiny or frailty or any other triviality:<br />
Love. </p>
<p>Love is the worst in men. </p>
<p>How wickedly short it lasts, how replicatable it seems,<br />
How quickly it fades, how easily forgotten, </p>
<p>How horrible are men to remember to forget,<br />
How undutious it seems, how cruel, how remorseless,<br />
How unabashed, how base…</p>
<p>Where be the virtue in love alone? Where be the pleasures<br />
Without commitment?</p>
<p>Yet I cannot confess to any crimes just yet; but I am broken all the while.<br />
Facing all fanciful ideas of love and loving and benign in one’s love<br />
Yet still smile.</p>
<p>I cannot muster a moral as there is not one;<br />
Nature gives and takes as it sees fit;<br />
Or God or something or nothing;<br />
But if you’d prefer a moral look to this:<br />
Look much further than the first kiss.</p>
