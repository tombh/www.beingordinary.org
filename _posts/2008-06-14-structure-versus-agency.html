<p>Amnesty could be a plague,<br />
For we lack truth and agreement -<br />
What is true?</p>
<p>Has the world suddenly become so large,<br />
Has the media and the medium become<br />
So disagreeable that we must come to some<br />
Disproportionate agreement about what<br />
Constitutes a person?</p>
<p>How to govern six billion... nine billion<br />
And so much agreed capital as to how to govern...<br />
Has the world really become that unmanagable?<br />
Has the forth Estate become the first Estate?<br />
Is the management enough?</p>
<p>Rue the day that I cannot love for lack of bread,<br />
Kill the man that killed the baker,<br />
The good is only as good as you agree that it is -<br />
All else is vanity.</p>
