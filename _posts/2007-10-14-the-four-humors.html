<p>What a journey down Icarus must have had having deceived Apollo!<br />
Oh the flight up must have been daunting,<br />
But the fall, recognising all of the familiar happening in reverse!</p>
<p>Such as it is to think – to live in constant motion forward,<br />
And discover everything backwards.</p>
<p>Our fluids are our teachers –<br />
To cough blood is to know what it is to breath,<br />
To cut open our buboes is to understand our closeness to others,<br />
To eat the afterbirth of our creations is to believe in true nourishment,<br />
For we suckle like pigs at the elixir of life<br />
And do our best to lock death from our door.</p>
<p>Cancer is forever nipping at our heels,<br />
Asking demanding laughing at our mortal whims,<br />
So we dream new frontiers to dance out our death<br />
To rhythms and chords unplayed<br />
May we tempt Hades to release our Euridices with<br />
The fruits of our voices…<br />
May our harmonies scream soft tunes of gratitude<br />
To love and life.</p>
<p>To give back the fire to deserted souls<br />
I would pluck out my own liver each night<br />
No crows needed<br />
If but a candle were lit with that fire<br />
I stole from the Gods.</p>
<p>May my kidneys become a dialysis machine<br />
For Humanity<br />
If only that fire could be of use.</p>
