<p align="center">I saw you and could not help but celebrate - I felt in carnival:</p>
<p align="center">a roaring, devotional wave, cheering and cresting across Space, smoothly</p>
<p align="center">grooving a gully of sigils into God's rock, past which</p>
<p align="center">the bruised sinews of Time and Matter would flow, reformed,</p>
<p align="center">enchanted and balmed.</p>
<p align="center">As if the whole space and span of the universe,</p>
<p align="center">every atom of it,</p>
<p align="center">waited only for the harmony of us; as though it could be no more</p>
<p align="center">than a basin of water that only we could hold still,</p>
<p align="center">brightly painted, your eyes at the bottom, my eyes above,</p>
<p align="center">recognising everything.</p>
<p align="center">This was the momentary, unpremeditated poise of you,</p>
<p align="center">the hidden commotion before the sudden calming of your eyes,</p>
<p align="center">your smile into my twisting</p>
<p align="center">gut as you unshielded and looked at me,</p>
<p align="center">brilliantly.</p>
<p align="center">Possibility was born:</p>
<p align="center">a team of mutinous, radiant dancers</p>
<p align="center">bursting from beneath jeweled veils,</p>
<p align="center">wrists lilting ringing feet thumping,</p>
<p align="center">innumerable arms raised in bells, bound</p>
<p align="center">to dance evermore</p>
<p align="center">through every priceless, meticulous, abandoned clue of you.</p>
<p align="center">I am as still as a sentinel as they encircle you,</p>
<p align="center">wind their thieves' fingers about your holy fruit,</p>
<p align="center">as they fantasize the rituals of lovers,</p>
<p align="center">laughing and hushing and locked.</p>
<p align="center">They are dancing a carnival of wing beats,</p>
<p align="center">lonely as swallows,</p>
<p align="center">ecstatic as golden pheasants,</p>
<p align="center">pounding and drumming their feet for us, already</p>
<p align="center">determined as water on rock.</p>
<p align="center">What those imperturbable sea-eyes have wrought;</p>
<p align="center">I looked into the heart of them and love as great as an atom was conceived,</p>
<p align="center">everything reformed,</p>
<p align="center">Radha singing.</p>
