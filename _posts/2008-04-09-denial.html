<p>Take it all back,<br />
usurp the death you brought here;<br />
uncreate what you claim<br />
beg forgiveness of your frankensteins,<br />
disturb again the balance you hide behind<br />
the blemished face you cower<br />
with your banal achievements<br />
in the face of that which you could have done better</p>
<p>There is nothing here worth preserving,<br />
There is nothing here to clothe this plague behind,<br />
No ocean big enough to swallow the lands,<br />
No heat enough to kill off the bacterial swamps</p>
<p>Only death will create your longing<br />
And dry your bleeding heart...<br />
The bones eschew their own delight<br />
In the sound they make trapped in the<br />
Molers of their creator...</p>
<p>Milk, anyone?</p>
