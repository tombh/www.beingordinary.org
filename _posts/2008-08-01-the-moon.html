<p>The lament of the unrequited world<br />
Sounds ruffles of blinding temper along<br />
Treble sands; gulls breast hunger in hollow<br />
Cries and fits of azure. Sand echoes<br />
The lay of repeating tides, unmooned.</p>
<p>Dusk and dim, I lean my breath close; for all<br />
That my voice is wet with light, this pale<br />
Feeling frosts but a few sands. Patient shells<br />
I leave abandoned to the burn of time.</p>
<p>I exhale orbs of shine and rhythm<br />
Acknowledgement on the shells beneath<br />
This twilight of soft breath, soothing the dust.</p>
<p>Soon I starve for air and wane so empty;<br />
Lapsing in to a moment of inhale,<br />
I torture the world with my breath once more.</p>
