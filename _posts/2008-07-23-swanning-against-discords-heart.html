<p>I write this poem for Wallace Stevens. I read 'Invective Against Swans' yesterday and cried.</p>
<p>I bequeth unto his moon and sacred the wet light.</p>
<p><strong> Swanning Against Discord's heart</strong></p>
<p>Bronze rains laurels and fits entrails,         </p>
<p>Crowns the burning cord of mouthing ganders.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The park, bound in vanity, hoofs the crush,      </p>
<p>Homes for the cankering of war marches.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All the valved voices foot along a dead rust.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The confused fetlocks of summer invect   </p>
<p>The Golden Apple to the barren winds;</p>
<p>They pregnant the muck of blowing feathers</p>
<p>Inisde the hollow of earthly sweetness.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I stop the chill of Her chariot-sails,</p>
<p>Inveigh with the stars and shine radiance;</p>
<p>I return the twain of Her to the flanks,</p>
<p>Solid her steed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I mount my soul,</p>
<p>Praise and white the gleam of healing blanks.</p>
<p>I sacrament these tides and descend from</p>
<p>The skies beyond.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I accept my sorrow, O fair Helen,</p>
<p>And swan-foot the sand pearls of my Troy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I walk unvalved.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The whole of my voice toes beaches in sand;</p>
<p>I glass and anoint with bright, living tears.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I gentle Discord's mouth, swan her the waves.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Inside foam and salt, I warble my heart</p>
<p>As I kiss Her so beneath the pale moon.                                             </p>
