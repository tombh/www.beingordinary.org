<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">Hi everyone, </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">I just thought i'd share this with you, its from my father who trained as a Buddhist monk and now teaches Vipassana all over the world (</font> <a href="http://www.puredhamma.org/">http://www.puredhamma.org/</a>):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">Tuesday is the full moon day of May, which in Buddhist tradtion marks the anniversary of the birth, enlightenment and death of Siddhartha Gotama, the Buddha.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">The teaching of the Buddha is not a religious teaching but a teaching of liberation for everyone. With this in mind I share with you Desiderata.<br />
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">It was an important part of my training thiry five years ago and still resonates today. </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="4">I offer it with my best wishes for you, May you be well and happy,</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm" align="center"><strong>DESIDERATA </strong></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others; even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Keep interested in oyur own career however humble; it is a real posession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Be yourself. Espacially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 16pt" size="4">With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy </font></p>
