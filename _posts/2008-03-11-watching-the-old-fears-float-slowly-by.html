<p>Verily, the head wobbles and the arch sinks back into the neck again<br />
As the sonnet shrieks and skits away<br />
None of that sort of form today</p>
<p>A lax of philosophical insight might do the reader and the poet some good<br />
On this occasion<br />
With the thought that the only thing that the<br />
Poet really chooses<br />
Is<br />
Where<br />
To Put the<br />
New Line</p>
<p>Prose happens when you use punctuation ,./?'! and let the typesetter do the exclaiming for you it always bores me to talk about form when writing a poem about form but today I forgot to bring my treasure trove of memories and platitudes about life to ponder upon. </p>
<p>But in order to publish something I'll mearly quote this evening Yeat's lament:</p>
<p>All men are in love,<br />
And they love what vanishes...<br />
What more is there to say?</p>
