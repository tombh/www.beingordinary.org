<p>I was told by a friend<br />
That she flashed some boys from Sudan<br />
In the park<br />
She says she’s depressed<br />
So I brought her breakfast<br />
And she told me who she loved<br />
All of them<br />
I was curious that she loved all these people who had left her –<br />
I didn’t know if she didn’t mention me out of courtesy<br />
But I had a suspicion that if I left her there<br />
She’d love me soon enough</p>
<p>Another friend told me that she slept with her friend’s partner<br />
She felt bad because she knew that the friend would forgive him<br />
No matter what he did<br />
She asked me if I knew the difference between love and real love<br />
So I lied and said that I did<br />
Real love is sacrifice I replied<br />
The other is just having an opinion<br />
She got angry and ordered another wine</p>
<p>A third friend noticed that I wasn’t really writing poetry anymore<br />
That I was instead just writing things down<br />
I told her that I no longer noticed the difference<br />
Between a good poem and a bad poem<br />
She said you no longer love it<br />
I didn’t reply – I'd forgotten that what I say<br />
Is so damn important</p>
