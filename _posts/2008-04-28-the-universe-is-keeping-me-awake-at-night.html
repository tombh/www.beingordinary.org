<p>Blinkers on, I'm turning into something I don't recognise;<br />
Demons wafting through this light littered city as smoke and puffery:<br />
Surely we killed off the devils and angels by now;<br />
What need faith to explain away the night skies natural fires<br />
As death in its penultimate summoning of the soul towards the sky<br />
Would see merely a sparse collection of lights north and south of the stratospheres...</p>
<p>Morose, Morbid Melancholic and Melodic;<br />
If only I could summise something greater than the parts of the whole<br />
The words become more than words - books become poems, paragraphs beautious cadences,<br />
The longer the life the lesser the requirement to understand it distinctly.</p>
<p>May I suffer always under the miscomprehension that I fully understand what it is to be a man.</p>
<p>For that would be heaven enough. </p>
