<p>They, the all knowing other,<br />
Knocking elbows and knees together in unison,<br />
Heads crouched and thighs hogging the midriff,<br />
Chased of imagination, longing wondrously for the womb,<br />
Make formiable comrades in the embattled sagas<br />
Of day to day living.</p>
<p>The illustrious cry of 'surrender' is the first technique,<br />
Torture unnecessary, as they whither helplessly<br />
Crackling in the sunlight of retreat from empathy.</p>
<p>Where be the barricades? Who need an enemy within<br />
These ranks; a rancour opposition would be desired<br />
Amongst such pithy wealth and tirade of accolades<br />
Of posturing, indulgence and superstitious indifference.</p>
<p>What dam will hold this water of apathy, this surreptitious<br />
Irreverence to existence in and for itself? Where be the springs<br />
And wells of joy, goodness, truth and beauty? Why are we waiting?</p>
<p>The majesty of poetry wrung dry, with shrugs of insolence and entropy<br />
Pervading each stanza they eye;<br />
No music to be heard, no texture to be felt,<br />
No wine to be tasted, no fragrance to be smelt;</p>
<p>Smelt it all in the great fire, burn the town<br />
So that beauty may arise from the ashes,<br />
And that misery will not be a common noun.</p>
