<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>if you don't mind, I'd like to partake in the traversal of the medium (again) for a bit if not to flesh out some of the greater {and lesser} points of the un-uncanniness and the lack of 'sheer' occurrings - I do so with the mind of a former contributer to ask some simple albeit meaningful questions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Isn't this entire project about negating the 'can'?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Why can't you?"</p>
<p>"I just can't"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE <em>just</em>ice of the castrated moment IS that it  requires poetry...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the "Point" being the 'Sheerness' of the negation of the canny. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In other words, what <em>is</em> the UNsheerness of the Canny/The 'can'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P</p>
