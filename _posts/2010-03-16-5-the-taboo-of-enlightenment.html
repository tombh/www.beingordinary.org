<p>We've gone for the big one this time, Enlightenment, the end of the search and not to mention a pretty cool chat-up line. What is it? How do you know you've got it? And should you say you have it? We mention a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RQmnSJoRg" target="_blank">Bill Hicks sketch which you can watch for yourself here</a>. Music is provided by Tom, the song is called Angi and was composed by <a href="http://www.bertjansch.com/" target="_self">Bert Jansch</a>. As far as we can tell this isn't an often discussed topic so we'd love to hear any feedback you have about it.</p>
