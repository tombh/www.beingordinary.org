<p>For the all times</p>
<p>For all the times I forgot to remember,<br />
For the all times I forget to remember,<br />
For the latent times I remembered to forget,<br />
For the forgetful times I forgot to remember,<br />
Black marks over the red penned corrections,<br />
Of thoughtful blunders made in the memory<br />
Of forgotton times for forlorn things that remain<br />
Nameless only because they remain without nouns<br />
Or correctly conjugated verbs.</p>
<p>For all the times I did ill, and meant it.<br />
For all the times I didn't do ill, but meant it.<br />
For all the times I did ill, and didn't mean it.<br />
For all the times I didn't do ill or mean it,<br />
I especially apologise for neither meaning or doing.</p>
<p>I imagine myself crazy, as who would bear their soul for anything less than productivity? I imagine my soul being productive, an incorruptable engine of the world state that has yet to be born - yes, a mid-wife of the world state, to see a great birth full of fear and eyes wide open for the apocalypse - a state of bliss ready to hand the world hand over fist to itself.</p>
<p>Just as we said it would be.<br />
Just as we said it wouldn't be.<br />
Just as we said it should be.<br />
Just as we said it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>I prefer to think of myself as one of the dead, already buried, already forgotton, already missed to be missed, breaking rocks in space trying to make a new sun, but one that will last longer and better than the last amongst a strange, burning cinder CANCER CANCER death screams pause no state will invent the cure of death we'll just have to cope with the system, solar, molecular, logical and metaphyscial that we have.</p>
<p>THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ISN'T A NAME OF A DISEASE YET. </p>
<p>For all the times that I got for the forgetfulness that I have,<br />
I guess I should acknowledge that at least I amâ€¦ for the time being.<br />
