<p>I have done more work on my large poem '<a rel="attachment wp-att-178" href="http://www.sheeruncanniness.co.uk/wordpress/?attachment_id=178" title="I song with sun">I song with sun</a>'.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been giving a great of my thought to the meaning of sound, movement and language. The questions I have been asking myself are:</p>
<p>How does the tongue contribute to meaning?<br />
What is the significance of 'the turn' (which is what verse (L. versum) means)?<br />
What is the length of thought - is it the length of a breath?<br />
How many syllables in a breath?<br />
What is the meaning of various syllablic combinations of parsed segements?</p>
<p>For instance,  a 2:2:1 combination is generally pregnant, lingering; whereas a 2:1:2 combination, seems more conclusive, finishing.  </p>
<p>What is the effect of stressed and unstressed syllables? How much does it matter where they occur in the line?<br />
To what degree is beauty a combination of proportion and symmetry?<br />
What is the effect of repeating sounds and rhythms? How about varying them?<br />
Does a rhyme, for instance, conflate meanings from different sections of the text, reaching across Time, invoking memory but somehow as a pure 'Now'? To what degree?<br />
What modes of thought are involved in reading - is there horizontal and vertical thought? Is there a difference between motion and movement?</p>
<p>This sort of thing. The updated version of my poem utilises some of my insights - for better or worse.</p>
