<p>No no, don´t try to recomfort me from my loneliness, ´cause you don´t exist.<br />
See it´s like this:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If i am this first and then become that, then what am i really? This or that?<br />
None, or maybe everything.<br />
And from all those things, there is nothing to be said, except that...<br />
There is.<br />
And this can only be me, though it's not the me you know.<br />
And you? Well, you may simply be the product of my mind.<br />
I wish i could come to you and tell you i didn't want to hurt your feelings,<br />
But it wouldn't make sense now.<br />
Besides, I am everywhere, because there is no other place than where i am.<br />
There is nothing to do: the World is in me<em> </em>and that might just be a good news to you...</p>
<p><em>Deep sigh ...</em></p>
