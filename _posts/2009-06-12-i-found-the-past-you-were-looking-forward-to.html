<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I find the time you need to lose to feel empty again</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You locate the space I want to be lonely in</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I search the empty space you require to be needy</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You penetrate the shallowness of my depth</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I lost the weight you were carrying and need a receipt for tax purposes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You brought the fuzz that I missed when I watch too much television</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I create the symptom of the therapy you have to keep yourself guilty</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You place the nothingness I forsook to remind others to pray</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I project the waste necessary for you to pretend that everything is dirty</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You protect the thing I hate the most which keeps me divided from what I want</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I count the blessings you hoard like small insects running in my skull</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You prevent the future by pretending that you miss me when I’m here</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I confuse the closeness we have with the distance you feel from the sun</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You burn the whole fucking house down why would you be so careless</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I help your family remind themselves that they didn’t really like you anyway</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You conduct the survey of the thing that if I knew it existed I’d probably kill you</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am the symptom to the cure you need to survive another day on this rock</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are the disease I forget to notice each time I stare directly through you</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I could be forgetfulness in its purest formula if you could only remember to do so</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You lost the past I was looking forward to –</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks</p>
