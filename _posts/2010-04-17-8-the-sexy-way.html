<p>This week Tom and I are dimming the lights, popping open a bottle of red, and relaxing on a giant water bed as we discuss sex and spirituality. Thanks to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thisissarahjoy" target="_blank">Sarah Joy</a> for her song 'Let me stay'. All comments and questions welcome below.</p>
