<p>Thoughts and thoughts and thoughts;<br />
Ought they be outrighteous,<br />
Outrageous and automotive<br />
As they think they are?</p>
<p>Building structures with these thoughts<br />
Rhyming, cascading, rupturing minds<br />
With platitudes seeking futile<br />
Plateaus within cadences and crimson white<br />
Poles that tipple the signifiers mutely<br />
Given nothings great a plethora?</p>
<p>Why tiptoe endlessly through these fields<br />
Of meanderings of meaninglessness<br />
Hoping to capture anything but<br />
Baseless musings of soulless pontificators<br />
On the inability to canvas truisms<br />
In the face of irreconcilability?</p>
<p>I cough beatified at the trundling<br />
Visited upon the unknown frolics<br />
Of these unwoven pages of modern awe;<br />
What possibilities seemed endless are<br />
Nevertheless simple bells ringing<br />
At funerals yet to be held,<br />
Of carcases yet to be eaten,<br />
In tombs yet to be built;</p>
<p>We, poor witnesses to these piteous<br />
And pious botherings dreaming forward,<br />
Glaring backward, confused daily<br />
By sitting only a little while<br />
And remarking simple echoes of thinkings<br />
Thought before:</p>
<p>How strange it is that we go forward<br />
And remember all in reverse...</p>
<p>A thought worth remembering while<br />
Watching loved ones carried off in a hearse.</p>
