<p>Looking out of my window I am blessed by the sight of a tree, shining yellow in its Autumnal beauty. I am reminded of Ikkyu who wrote "Oh  green green willow, wonderfully red flower, but I know the colours are not there."</p>
<p>Yet not only are the colours not there but there is <em>no one</em> to see them.</p>
<p>Yet <em>seeing</em> happens and that, is beauty.</p>
