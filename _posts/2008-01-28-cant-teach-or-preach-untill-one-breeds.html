<p>Cathartic eruptions in the bored insomniac<br />
Bringing forth repetitions of hospitality<br />
The desperation strangles any attempt<br />
To be amongst those who wait around<br />
To do that which they were present for</p>
<p>Be vague, say the myths and songs,<br />
Give no advice other than sufference or love,<br />
Test either to be undone by both,<br />
Prepare for all that fall until forswarn<br />
Under either aether - one will suffer love<br />
Or love will make one suffer.</p>
<p>The trick, dear friends is to make both whole;<br />
To love the suffering as a thing to make<br />
Another's suffering into love...<br />
For none can read this without proof<br />
That such a thing is value.</p>
<p>Whoever trusts the baker before the bread<br />
Is a pariah awaiting his meal.</p>
