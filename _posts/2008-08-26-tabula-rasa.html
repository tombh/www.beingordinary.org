<p>To make each day more forgotten than the last,<br />
Needs tears at least to help with the severity of each loss,<br />
The thankless task of memory needs clever alteration,<br />
Deliberate douses of medicinal grapes and horticultural fortitude.</p>
<p>No love is too great to be drowned from the fruit of these vines,<br />
No company too good to be placed aside disarmingly,<br />
No forlorn habit too ingrained to be forbidden by these spirits,<br />
No drudgery that these immaculate drugs cannot cure.</p>
<p>The great purifier of the soul, the metaphysical carwash,<br />
The acidic bath of absolution, the alkaline of all ill,<br />
Baptise me again, dear potion of amnesia,<br />
My tear ducts simply cannot clear this misery - </p>
<p>I fear.</p>
