<p>I tried to write a post on the 'Quote of the Day' thread. Instead, I flowed a tongue of voice far too poetic to be suitable (since I'm trying to keep poetry to a minimum on that thread). I got lost in the power of 'focus', the Latin 'foci' that is fire, the hearth.</p>

<p>From the bottom of your post, climbing the ladder of song,<br />
Passing over everything with whispers of feeling, thumb so delicate and gentle,<br />
Evening cradled in the dustings of my eyelashes,<br />
Fragrant throat collecting, gathering and spreading the grass at dawn.</p>
<p>I shall loaf the music of your writing, talking the noiseless splendour,<br />
Warming myself at the convergence of sound,<br />
Sloughing cloudy ink to arrive at the beginning,<br />
Talking the impossible, clinging breast-to-breast, harmonic plenty without evasion,<br />
Loafing the crinkle of autumn leaves, the crackle of ever-returning spring,<br />
The winter chill drooping fronds of pearlescent snow,<br />
The summer thaws, cycling the dust of age, trebling the splendour of all that was,<br />
Seasons in my heart, organing my body, vibrating so sure,<br />
Issuing pollens of sound from the floodgates electric.<br />
 <br />
Loafing eternity with a human sound, smiling at the house I see,<br />
The abode of joyous Being I see,<br />
The house so welcoming I see,<br />
The house so empty of ink and so full of language I see,<br />
The carpets soft, the decanters lush with grape, the floors freshly cedared.</p>
<p>Opening the door, I flare my nostrils,<br />
Scent the odours of my home,<br />
Grass, pollen and the breath I am mad for,<br />
The breath I fit to touch, the breath I yawp my glee for.</p>
<p>A thrush fluffs its feathers as I fire the hearth with flame,<br />
Braiding orange, yellow and red, twistings of human song,<br />
Colours shining in the wink of my flaring spectacles.</p>
<p>Tongues of fire twining the luxuriant melt of my mouth,<br />
Holding my head back, throat stretched and happy,<br />
Gurgling the satisfaction of the dim and dark,<br />
Long and unvalved, the music of celebration.<br />
 <br />
As silent as the sun I speak,<br />
Crooning midnight to those alone, weaving the dreaming universe,<br />
Resting in the crook of an arm, slumbering as the hour grows fat and long.</p>
<p>Outside, you loafe the golden dim, irresistible, drawn to the house I love,<br />
Beginning to clear your throat, approaching the house I adore<br />
Beginning to clear your throat, valved hummings growing so sure.</p>
<p>Hearth crackling, singing and awaiting the humanity I love,<br />
Grass blooming the awakenings of my smile across a gentle door,<br />
A fire warming the cedars, rich, inkless love, curling joyous breath.</p>
