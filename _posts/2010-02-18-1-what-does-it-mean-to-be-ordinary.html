<p>In the first podcast we discuss what it means to be ordinary and how the idea of attaining something extra-ordinary can often act as a barrier to the simplicity of being. The music is provided by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/whattheanimalssay" target="_blank">Whatthe Animalssay </a>a singer-songwriter from the Isle of Man, currently living in Melbourne, Australia. We would appreciate any feedback, questions or comments below.</p>
