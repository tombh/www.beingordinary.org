<p><a href="http://www.stephenbatchelor.org/">Stephen Batchelor</a> is a Buddhist <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=stephen+batchelor&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">writer</a> and teacher, who trained in both the Tibetan and Zen traditions. He is well known for bringing contemporary worldviews to bear on traditional Buddhist teachings, some find his rejection of karma and rebirth controversial. I met up with him at <a href="http://www.gaiahouse.co.uk/">Gaia House</a>, a retreat centre in Devon, UK whilst he was teaching his annual <a href="http://www.gaiahouse.co.uk/course.php?code=10153">Meditation and Study retreat</a> with his wife <a href="http://www.martinebatchelor.org/">Martine</a>. A huge thank you to Stephen for taking the time to be interviewed :)</p>
<p>The music is by tom and is an arrangement of Yann Tiersen's <em>Comptine d'un autre été</em>, which was popularised by the classic French film <em>Amélie</em>.</p>
