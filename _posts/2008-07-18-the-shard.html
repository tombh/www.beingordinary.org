<p align="center">I raised it. I wrested it from the river's dim, convoluted depths:</p>
<p align="center">a darkly glittering volcanic shard - my mother;</p>
<p align="center">my formation; her histories</p>
<p align="center">of magmatic eruptions, the vast gathered clouds and poorly settling debris.</p>
<p align="center">They had become quiet at last, drowned and anchored in a chill green flow.</p>
<p align="center">I lunged in again and again to prise it from the algae, which clung</p>
<p align="center">as though it had birthed the thing. I wrenched and tore</p>
<p align="center">and away it came in a flurrying blossom of mud,</p>
<p align="center">the rock glinting and constraining my palms as I clambered on to the bank.</p>
<p align="center">I eyed its every worked angle, twisting it in the sunlight, testing its triangulations, its flat</p>
<p align="center">flats, its perfectly reflected dark visions,</p>
<p align="center">and its one broad edge polished to a clear, flat meniscus.</p>
<p align="center">A thick black break ran the depth of it, backwards, into its heart;</p>
<p align="center">and from this, five small ruptures emanated like desperate little claw marks.</p>
<p align="center">It was as though at these crucial points, as the ashes had blown</p>
<p align="center">out of the door with her, we had all been removed</p>
<p align="center"> with precision</p>
<p align="center">from the critical mass of her.</p>
<p align="center">Remaining too, as absences - airy, imprinted.</p>
<p align="center">She lived her life away.</p>
<p align="center">A sputtering fire on the other side of a large curtain,</p>
<p align="center">through which I later saw her pass, back into fire and ash.</p>
<p align="center">Some power ballad hoovered up the howls: my brother and I bewildered</p>
<p align="center">that after all her rage and mystery she had only</p>
<p align="center">burned calmly like an ordinary person</p>
<p align="center">and not exploded like Mount Tambora.</p>
<p align="center">
<p align="center">It was in a damp, encasing silence,</p>
<p align="center">that I stared at the wilting flowers: blank irises,</p>
<p align="center">overblown tiger lilies already browning at their tips.</p>
<p align="center">My grandmother had insisted I take them: she had no use,</p>
<p align="center">she growled, for all these damn blooms.</p>
<p align="center">She would be emptying the urn another day</p>
<p align="center">in one final, long, grey breath across a moor.</p>
<p align="center">I don't know which one.</p>
<p align="center">But washed downstream from it, deposited where I could find her - Here she is -</p>
<p align="center">an instantaneous coalescence of her energy and matter,</p>
<p align="center">bypassing the long, slow forge,</p>
<p align="center">as she always, always did.</p>
<p align="center">And now I have it - This darkly glittering shard â€“ I raised it.</p>
<p align="center">It is my mother.</p>
