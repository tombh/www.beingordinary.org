<p>Our 3rd podcast and we decided to go for the jugular of the great self/no-self debate. We mention a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html" target="_blank">TED talk which you can watch for yourself here</a>. Music by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd" target="_blank">Pink Floyd</a>. As always, we welcome any comments or feedback.</p>
<p>Enjoy :D</p>
<p>Tom and Mike</p>
