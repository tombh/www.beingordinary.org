<p>Emily and Vincent Horn run the <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/" target="_blank">Buddhists Geeks project</a>, a website that has regular podcasts and articles about spiritual matters with a modern Web 2.0 approach. Their site is a big inspiration for our own. We discuss ordinariness and the rewards and challenges of intimate relationships.</p>
