<p>Hello, it's been a while but we're really happy to offer up another interview to Being Ordinary. Mike speaks with Non-duality teacher and Mother,  Prajna,  about  the direct path, enlightenment, detachment and the importance of embodiment. We look forward to your  feedback, comments and questions.</p>
<p>Prajna's website is <a href="http://prajnalivingawake.org" target="_blank">Prajnalivingawake.org</a></p>
<p>Her book <i><a href="http://prajnalivingawake.org/edge-of-grace/" target="_blank">Edge of Grace: The Seeker’s Path to the Heart of Liberation</a> </i>is available now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">Prajna is a spiritual teacher, guide and author of </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>Living Awake </i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">and </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>Edge of Grace: The Seeker’s Path to the Heart of Liberation. </i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"> Prajna is known for her depth of presence, unabated compassion and potent message for reclaiming your innate wisdom. Inspired by Ramana Mahashi, her root teacher Adyashanti, and her children, Prajna’s teachings are practical, non-dogmatic, and elicit the direct knowing of who we are amidst the beauty as well as challenge of everyday life.</span></p>
<p>Prajna came to spiritual realization by way of Mysticism and three decades of extensive training in the world’s wisdom traditions, depth psychology, and holistic healing. She graciously points to the truth and happiness that is already present and creates an open atmosphere of allowance that includes everything and leads to the deepest fulfillment in life.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">Prajna is the founder of </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>The Flowing River School and Sangha (2001)</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to inclusion of all people interested in liberation, as well as those with disabilities. She is also the creator of </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>The Living Awake Intensive (2006),</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"> a course that fosters embodiment of who we are, body, mind, and heart; integrating our deepest realization and walking bravely in our humanity. She is featured on such programs as </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>One Truth, Many Voices</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">; </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>Buddha at the Gas Pump</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">; </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>Living-from-Love</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">; </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>10,000 Awakenings</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">; and </span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;"><i>Conscious TV</i></span><span style="font-family: 'Avenir Book', serif;">.</span></p>
