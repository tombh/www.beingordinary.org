<p>What is presented here can often run the risk of sounding vague and intangible, so  to counter any nihilism or inactivity, Mike travels to Paris to talk Buddhist activism and Social Dharma with writer, scholar and long-term practitioner Martin Kovan. What does it mean to live from the heart on a day to day basis and why should we care?</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://whisperedlineage.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to access Martins articles, poetry and prose.</p>
<p>Martin is passionate about the situation in Myanmar so below are some links through which you can discover more about what's happening there and how you can help. He has also worked closely with Alan Clements whose website can be found <a href="http://www.worlddharma.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
