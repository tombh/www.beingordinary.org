<p>If not once a day,<br />
Then twice a day as punishment for not doing it once a day,<br />
Then resistance for being so harsh in terms of the punishment,<br />
Then the terms being considered once a day in consideration<br />
	Of what should be once a day;</p>
<p>Which should be thought about once a week,<br />
Amongst peers who are able to meet once a month,<br />
With meetings that have half the resolve<br />
	Of the original intent;</p>
<p>If not these peers that should meet once a month,<br />
Then we should reject half the peers that<br />
Appear half the time with twice the force<br />
Of the original intent of the first meeting<br />
With a document that will restrain half the resistance<br />
With twice the force to be considered once a year about what should be done<br />
	Of the original consideration</p>
<p>Which this document shall outline hear without contention<br />
Consideration, consternation or constitution:<br />
	Merry Christmas boys and girls,<br />
	Thanks for every day that was and will come of us,<br />
	May they be long and fruitful and bare many more<br />
	Wondrous musings than what we have yet to muster.</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned.</p>
