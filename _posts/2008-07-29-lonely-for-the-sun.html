<p>The tinted abbey slants<br />
lathes of nocturnal light<br />
in the throw of my home.<br />
Peopled steps clothe their faith,<br />
all the stony garments<br />
bounded beyond my sight;<br />
a spell of my own breath<br />
pools blacker still than the<br />
cast of my abbey-dark<br />
home; it strangles upon<br />
the bronze of revanant<br />
prayers I see only from<br />
a distance.</p>
<p>                 The grave soil<br />
choking on my feet bids<br />
me watch the dream of life;<br />
as I wait for my time<br />
to die unloved and ill,</p>
<p>                                                I touch the cold<br />
                                                                           of naked skin.</p>
