<p>I brought my love to the water,<br />
To shed her skin, soul and tears;<br />
Away away I cried,<br />
And away she did.</p>
<p>She left her image burned into my eyes,<br />
So that anywhere I turned I saw only her,<br />
I often return to those same waters<br />
To wash her out of my sight<br />
Only to find that she waits for me at that same place</p>
<p>I try to reach for her in the water<br />
To capture her once again,<br />
I built a well out of her memory but it dries up<br />
I channelled her into a stream but I just can’t hold her<br />
I should’ve been a builder or a fencer,<br />
Four wall to hold her in<br />
Two arms to hold her tight<br />
But these silly fingers thought he could hold her<br />
Now all I can see is her slipping right through.</p>
