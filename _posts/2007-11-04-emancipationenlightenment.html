<p>Yesterday I lost myself,<br />
Deliberately,<br />
I more or less misplaced it.<br />
I think I did anyway...</p>
<p>I found much in my new-found state of selflessness,<br />
I had so few responsibilities that I became free<br />
Of all those things that had troubled me for so long.</p>
<p>And the onset of the longing became boring,<br />
The wine had no flavour,<br />
The women had no flesh,<br />
The lungs breathed no air,<br />
The hope wasn’t a burden anymore.</p>
<p>So I found a cheap cask,<br />
Vintage 2007 the most recent,<br />
And removed myself from reality.</p>
<p>I want not, wash not, eat only to survive,<br />
And I am blessed. </p>
<p>I run not for trains, for time, for religion,<br />
For rhyme, rhythm or reason,<br />
I am the choir that you haven’t heard,<br />
The opera that will never be sung,<br />
The play that will never be performed,<br />
The book that will never be read.</p>
<p>I seek no love and get less.<br />
There is no war in the world,<br />
Nor in my soul.</p>
<p>You cannot undo me anymore than<br />
I can undo myself.<br />
I seek no help nor charity.</p>
<p>I reach for nothing, and I haven’t quite<br />
Reached it yet…</p>
<p>But I’ll get there… We’ll all get there.</p>
<p>Loved or not, we’ll get there.</p>
