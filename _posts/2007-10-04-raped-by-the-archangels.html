<p>Plough on, plough through, plough –<br />
By this hand and shovel and will<br />
I will turn this rock and sand ridden desert of mind<br />
Into a rich garden, full of plumes and phrases and wit,<br />
All to the purpose of removing the wire.</p>
<p>Imprisonment within our own dreams is such<br />
A tremendous poisonous stupendous deliberate entrapment.<br />
Nations bleeding and voting and participating<br />
Merely by listening or rejecting or hurling abuse at<br />
Race taste caste and letting little or nothing<br />
Persuade us that we may just be wrong.<br />
We are all wrong.</p>
<p>Let our dreams breed new species,<br />
Let our minds depart from their weary confines<br />
To seek out new blood to mix with.<br />
If our lands run dry should not our riches<br />
Be greater in dreaming of new collective heavens;<br />
And may they not be perfect heavens<br />
As our beliefs are not better off for their charity status –<br />
Let the pain and suffering of this life<br />
Be a compass to recognising the sufferings of all,<br />
Not of ourselves;<br />
For when we dream of being whose being are we dreaming of?<br />
Ours, or our own?</p>
<p>I cannot fight for time beyond my own –<br />
My time is mine, but it is shared time.<br />
So have my dreams and do with them what you may.<br />
Eat, drink, rape or kill them as you see fit –<br />
Better they be killed than go unnoticed or unrealised.</p>
