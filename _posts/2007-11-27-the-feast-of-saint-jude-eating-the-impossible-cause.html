<p>Someone/thing put a magnet in my heart<br />
It acts as a repellent, and at other times<br />
A disinfectant.</p>
<p>Open heart surgery sounds enticing<br />
Something to match my iron lung<br />
Designer organs are all the fashion this season<br />
Sutures running up and down the torso<br />
Pins and needles in my retinas<br />
Arteries dangling from the ceiling<br />
Give me the good graces to remain a puppet<br />
A Marionette YES THANKS guide me good master<br />
I renege the responsibility of my motor functions</p>
<p>Beat me down with random debris you find<br />
Floating about these puddles of my dreams<br />
They do torment me to follow them all<br />
But the dreams scream/shriek/speak to me each night<br />
Can’t chase them, can’t catch them<br />
So then let them hang me tight in their noose<br />
Whilst I try to swat away the future<br />
Narcolepsy sounds tempting<br />
The dreaming awake<br />
Burning leaving ash<br />
Of hope</p>
<p>Hope no more<br />
Despairing no longer<br />
Suckling like a new born on each day<br />
Until the marrow is gone<br />
Leaving only the bone to gnaw upon</p>
