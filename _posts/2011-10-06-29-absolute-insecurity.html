<p>Mike speaks with Unmani about her journey to awakening and the importance of resting with, and experiencing,  our insecurities and vulnerabilities rather than avoiding them by searching for a state of so-called 'spiritual perfection'. Information about Unmani's satsangs, retreats and books can be found at her website, <a href="http://www.not-knowing.com/" target="_blank">www.not-knowing.com</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, comments and questions are appreciated.</p>
