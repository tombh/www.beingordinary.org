<p>Today a blossom said (in its own way):</p>
<p>"Look at me, there are roots, there are tendrils, sprouts and innumerable leaves all of them below and I, the blossom rise above them, unfolding my beauty while the sun caresses me."</p>
<p>"But listen Son of Men," she said.</p>
<p>"Would you see  roots, tendrils, sprouts and innumerable leaves and would you see me rising above them, then you would be blind. For safe Beauty, what unfolds, what caresses and what arises?"</p>
<p>And i stood still and watched for an eternity in a flash of vision, as i kept walking swiftly. And the blossom unfolded around and within me, all caressed by Beauty.</p>
