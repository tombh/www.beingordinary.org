<p>Boxes of jewells and rocks weeding gowns no typo<br />
No clarity no dignity no poetry just rhymes<br />
just words</p>
<p>No punctuation no! We don't need<br />
Sentence structure here/hear<br />
We have grown bored of<br />
Such things as words<br />
We catalogue more than the Dewey decimal system allows.</p>
<p>I read my DNA the other day<br />
And to my great relief it told me<br />
Exactly who I was, am and will be<br />
For the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I'd better get on with it then and forget about this nonsense;<br />
Someone else has already figured out who I am.</p>
<p>Thanks for that - I thought it may require some effort on my part.<br />
How wrong was I?</p>
