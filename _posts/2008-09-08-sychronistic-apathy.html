<p>On a more personal note:<br />
Never engage with polarities;<br />
Up is down to Black is white,<br />
There the dawn bleeds into night/<br />
The joust for meaning implies<br />
The engagement with the enemy;<br />
All are friend and foe except<br />
That Ideology design to make it so.</p>
<p>Armies, like countries exclude all but base<br />
Revision of ideas long forlorn or much longer<br />
Forgotten.<br />
Preferably forgotten, as memory is our greatest liability<br />
As well as our greatest asset.<br />
Harry the North again dear<br />
Norseman of the Apocalypse;<br />
Death reigns truer for lands<br />
Starved of their origins,<br />
Clensed of their histories,<br />
What need of new truth<br />
When such seedlings can be born each day.</p>
<p>Recoil dearest foreign memories,<br />
Care not for such whims and wares of old -<br />
New days of bliss await with stories untold<br />
And mountains of gold to wash away glories unfolded<br />
And pact upon fires to burn on the bryers;<br />
But the truth is that we tear out new leaves<br />
In every pamphlet we toss asunder,<br />
The truth is the truth returns memory or not,<br />
The truth is we can burn the past -<br />
Not at least until we rot.</p>
