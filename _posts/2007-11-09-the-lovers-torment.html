<p align="center">Do they who really love, suffer from loving?</p>
<p align="center">When they love the world so much as to want to join both ends together?</p>
<p align="center">When they love the world so much they wouldn't dare bothering it</p>
<p align="center">Talking about Love itself?</p>
<p align="center">If you know the answer, come cry with Benjamin.</p>
<p align="center">Because these tears will make the moon feel shy tonight.</p>
<p align="center">Until the sun rises again.</p>
