<p>Everything floats when you try to write what you think - Nothing, space, time, things beyond absolute measurement. But yet, it is such a simple requirement of being - thinking, and then writing. Fear of causality is perhaps both why we shouldn't - and why we should - write... what we think... </p>
<p>I think that I'm constantly torn between thoughts; which thoughts when should be judged how? Which loves? Which wants? And whenever I get such emotional fluxes I resort to the experts... musicians, poets, playwrites, novelists, philosophers... most of whom are long departed from our times and have no knowledge of them. </p>
<p>They have all left trails that are read, interpreted, decerned, analysed and argued upon. </p>
<p>So let our children's children's peers rummage through the ruins of our broken thoughs and faint musings so that they too may learn of the songs insufficiency, the poems inidentifiability, the philosophers abstraction, the writers problem - there have been, there will be. </p>
<p>Why, or why not write... </p>
