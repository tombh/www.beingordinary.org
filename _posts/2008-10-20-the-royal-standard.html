<p>Yes, we're all here.</p>
<p>The roll call is a mere formality.</p>
<p>We are here.<br />
We have always been here.<br />
We've seen this coming.<br />
And we've been nice enough to refer to YOU as THEY.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Since we're all here,<br />
we'll continue to keep in line with the correct formality:</p>
<p>They have failed us.<br />
They have forgotten us.<br />
They have betrayed us.<br />
They don't even know who we are.<br />
And nor do they care.</p>
<p>The homeless walking into their houses...<br />
Oops, sorry about that, its a global issue...<br />
Here, 'scuse the rhyme, is a tissue;<br />
Don't waste too many, there's a tree at stake.</p>
<p>We shouldn't complain,<br />
We didn't know.<br />
They didn't know.<br />
Its out of their control.<br />
They couldn't help it.<br />
They didn't see.<br />
They do care,<br />
So give me our house, and here's your tissue.</p>
<p>Oops... rhyme crime again - we see an issue:<br />
Its not YOUR house, it is OUR house,<br />
Its not OUR problem, it is YOUR problem,</p>
<p>They say that Capitalism has two emotions -<br />
Greed and Fear;<br />
One is celebrated, the other exaserbated by ideology.</p>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>We have seen this all before;<br />
Once as tragedy, the next as farce;<br />
Life is not lived forwards and experienced backwards,<br />
We remember everything.</p>
<p>We will have our bread and eat it too;<br />
As a fellow Victorian once said:<br />
We are not amused.</p>
