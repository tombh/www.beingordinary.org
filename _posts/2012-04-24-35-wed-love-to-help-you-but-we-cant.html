<p>In this special episode Tom visits Mike on the Isle of Man. We address the seeking mind which listens to podcasts (such as this one) and reads spiritual books in the hope of finding golden nuggets of life changing wisdom, just as seagulls follow trawlers in the hope that sardines will be thrown into the sea. Unfortunately here at Being Ordinary we have no profundities to utter, no food for hungry gulls. All we can hope to offer is mere entertainment and perhaps the freedom which comes from giving up on chasing 'spiritual' concepts.</p>
