<p>This week Mike talks to Gilbert Shultz, co-founder of the <a href="http://urbangurucafe.com/" target="_blank">Urban Guru Cafe</a>, about his life, his website, his new ebook <a href="http://seeing-knowing.com/books-cd/" target="_blank">Resonance in the heart</a>,  and the prevalence of bullshit in spirituality. Thanks also to Gilbert for playing the mandolin for us. Comments and questions welcome below.</p>
