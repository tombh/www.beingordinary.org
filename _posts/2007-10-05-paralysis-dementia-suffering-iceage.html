<p>There is something comforting about a madhouse.<br />
To be at once in the company of hercules, aristophanes<br />
And men and women who don't know their minds,<br />
To be amongst those who work justly in the commerce of<br />
Knowing the line of possible and impossible -<br />
How strange it must be to dwell in the midst of such madness<br />
And know oneself madless.</p>
<p>Madness is this - to be awake and to fight against<br />
That which you were born into.<br />
Geography, time, and words themselves dictate<br />
Our being at every living moment -<br />
Who are we to fight against such forces?<br />
The Universe, expanding contracting existing<br />
Continually espouses indifference to our presence;<br />
It is our own presence that disturbs the dust we kick about<br />
As we toil to find peace amongst such a swamp of consciousness...</p>
<p>To be sane is to be a ship of fools sailing uncharted waters,<br />
Seeing, Hearing, Doing things for the first time every time,<br />
For to be a fool once is a blessing, but we are fools every time<br />
We awake.</p>
<p>So I say sail, set the fools of your mind drift with a broken compass,<br />
For you will find greater treasures by forging new Universes<br />
With your broken logic and your frayed imaginings<br />
Than any man with a grasp upon reality.</p>
<p>All is reality.</p>
<p>Madness is still the uncharted ocean.</p>
