<p>Mike speaks with Jon Bernie whose awakening at the age of 16 ignited a spiritual journey exploring  Zen, Vipassana and Advaita.  He studied with teachers such as Jean Klein, Robert Adams, Papaji and Adyashanti who in 2002 asked Jon to teach.  Supported by the Clear Water Sangha Jon offers regular classes and retreats in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.</p>
<p>Jon's website is <a href="http://www.jonbernie.org/">http://www.jonbernie.org/</a></p>
