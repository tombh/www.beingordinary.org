<p>I was born toothless,</p>
<p>The freedom of being tore through my body,</p>
<p>And even though I cannot remember it,</p>
<p>I know that I never complained -</p>
<p>For there was no-one to complain.</p>
<p>Then one day,</p>
<p>My first tooth!</p>
<p>From thay day until now I have used my teeth well;</p>
<p>Ceaslessly cutting and grinding, biting and holding.</p>
<p>My jaw never sleeps,</p>
<p>For there is always something else to be chewed into shape:</p>
<p>God or the Devil I beg you,</p>
<p>Please let me die toothless.</p>
