<p>Deaf...<br />
Deafeated...<br />
The fire gone, water earth air<br />
Merely considerations for mighty Nomos,<br />
The great Dragon perched upon the Caucasus,<br />
Peering knowingly into the bland abyss,<br />
Watching Promethius, beckoned daily to<br />
Rise again, despite the terror<br />
Awaiting him come dusk.<br />
Steely eyed, curled swiftly, ready to pounce<br />
To curtail the ills of human misery,<br />
Knowing too well of his presence is but an<br />
Abomination, cause and the savior of grief.</p>
<p>"What majestic beast will save these creatures<br />
From themselves? They rule the land, sea and now the sky,<br />
They carve them all between them unequally, and claim<br />
Nature as the reason for their spoils."</p>
<p>"What creature owns the sea? Even the largest suckles the seas<br />
Wonders without disturbance. What land animals want more than<br />
To live? What skybird beconds to own more than the majesty of flight?"</p>
<p>"What a terrible mess they make, groping for meaning<br />
Amongst such a rich graveyard... they discover ice age after<br />
Ice age and ne'er the cause."</p>
<p>"God after god they invent, kill, murder, assimilate, pause to recognise,<br />
Yet still chase simple paper and terrified ethics - the few that postulate<br />
A better method are the weaker sex, yet clearly refute the possibility<br />
That their own sporn won't be the cure."</p>
<p>"The old geographers were correct to note that 'here there be dragons';<br />
There were. Now they are lost - the old caretakers have gone,<br />
May the new dragons do better than we did."</p>
