<p align="center">Hidden behind the top of a street<br />
was a view that made me smile.<br />
Concealed within the maths of matter<br />
was a bomb that changed the world.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">It is not just our eyes that see,<br />
but our hands and hearts and minds.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Hidden behind a habit<br />
was a feeling that made me grow.<br />
Concealed within an ordinary life<br />
is the spark that changes the universe.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Thus ignited, the ensuing detonations<br />
obliterate more obstacles than any nuclear weapon.</p></p>
