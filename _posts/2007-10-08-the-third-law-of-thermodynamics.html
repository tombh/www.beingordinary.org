<p>These are actions, but they are not actions…<br />
You know your course, move on’t.<br />
Why wallow so openly in such a morass pit as this?<br />
Empires are to be taken,<br />
Rights are to be writ,<br />
Yet I swim these shallow waters thinking they are seas. </p>
<p>Make oneself the captain of one’s own life:<br />
Sail these unchartered realms of misery;<br />
Become the sum of all who might have been;<br />
Take responsibility for the temper of the sea!<br />
Whether it be a conjurer, Prospero,<br />
Or Hades shifting the planks on which the sea holds,<br />
Or God himself who slew his only son in spite of his own creation…<br />
Let them who hold such great esteem<br />
Not be responsible for these shifting tides which cause our misery,<br />
But we who crash against them. </p>
<p>Like the rock itself,<br />
Let Peter climb from this morass of selfish idolatry<br />
To place his church upon the rocks –<br />
Let no man, wind, sea or deity destroy that which he made. </p>
<p>These but be wild and whirling words, Peter.<br />
You denied yourself thrice.</p>
<p>Give me an action that seeks more clarity that the word itself -<br />
That one’s intent should follow its course,<br />
That one may set afloat upon a raft that is unsteady,<br />
That one may ask more of what one may learn of such a journey<br />
Than one may lose:<br />
If that be a fools errand that let me remain the fool,<br />
For such an errand takes less time with more profit<br />
Than ten thousand men who proclaim<br />
That they know what is in the deepest ocean<br />
Even before they drown. </p>
<p>Oh, but how a man that cries false<br />
Will in time call it true<br />
If it is for his profit;<br />
Is it not so? </p>
<p>Such is the tether and truth to a man’s mettle:<br />
Who can but withstand the temptations of hypocrisy and madness<br />
Given the opportune moment to fall from the perch -<br />
Gravity and man are in constant conflict. </p>
<p>Be not as a twig or a leaf, that can fall with a simple gust;<br />
But as a root that will spore many a seed no matter the weather:<br />
Time beckons both the feature and the result.<br />
Be not of either, for contrary to belief,<br />
One may set a pillar against death finer than marble:<br />
To attempt that which cannot be known. </p>
<p>And if such a deed or act ends in tyranny, sorrow or mirth?</p>
<p>Then let it be so:<br />
One cannot act without harm in good or evil;<br />
The attempt to good is worthy enough beyond any man’s pail. </p>
