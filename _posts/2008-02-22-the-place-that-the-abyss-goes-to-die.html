<p>When I awake I lace the missing hole in my shoe with a<br />
Reef knot<br />
It keeps recurring but that is just the sleeping<br />
Part of awakening<br />
It parts right down the centre of my consciousness<br />
Like a spiral<br />
Silly scribbling that I don't have the capacity or will<br />
To follow through on</p>
<p>Sometimes the dream frustrates me<br />
For I have heard of these recurring dreams that other<br />
Beings similar to my nature have<br />
They say that they are the same<br />
Never having repeated a dream<br />
I wonder that they imagine<br />
They have repeated their dream<br />
To make sense of their life<br />
Imagining that it is repeating<br />
It is not repeating it is the same thing happening<br />
At different times<br />
If you were a clock would you understand whether<br />
You were after or pre morning and<br />
Ponder where you were<br />
The world is still timed<br />
But the clocks are different<br />
Are we really that different?</p>
<p>Or just the same clock knowing itself again and again?</p>
<p>Nobody visits the place<br />
That the abyss goes to die...<br />
They just go there too.</p>
<p>I had this dream that didn't occur once<br />
It was about the next iceage<br />
That set our hearts in deep freeze<br />
Which thawed the great plains of Greenland and<br />
Destroyed the Earth</p>
<p>We begat Gods between us and bore pain<br />
Unheard of in ages gone by<br />
We made new worlds forgetting like our forebearers where<br />
From that we came<br />
So that we could be forgotten<br />
Once again</p>
