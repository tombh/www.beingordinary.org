<p>Choices.<br />
What’s wrong with my choices?<br />
THEY’RE MY FUCKING CHOICES.<br />
If you don’t like them, DON’T LIKE THEM!<br />
It doesn’t change anything.<br />
If you don’t like the choices you’ve made…<br />
TOO BAD, you’ve already made them.<br />
Regret them or don’t.<br />
Whatever you think you have time for.<br />
Whatever you think will help.<br />
Whatever you believe will serve you in some way. </p>
<p>Recognise the similarities between what you’re going through,<br />
And what others are going through in order to feel acceptable.<br />
Recognise the differences between what you’re going through,<br />
And what others are going through in order to feel individual. </p>
<p>Make up the rest.<br />
Design a new complex.<br />
Read a different opinion.<br />
Read a similar opinion.<br />
Think a lot, or not.<br />
Choose to change your choices. </p>
<p>Choices. What’s wrong with my CHOICES?</p>
<p>Nothing. Everything.</p>
<p>Something.</p>
<p>Whatever. </p>
