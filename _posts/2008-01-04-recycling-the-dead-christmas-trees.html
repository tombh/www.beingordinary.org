<p>New year’s solution:</p>
<p>Stop biting fingernails and spitting them out;<br />
They provide healthy nutritional value to one’s daily diet.</p>
<p>Start selling unused organs – one kidney, one lung, one femur;<br />
All are replacable for the right price, just make a market of yourself.</p>
<p>Stop selling your soul to disinterested agents,<br />
Find value or at least marketing skills to increase your producce worth,<br />
Then sell.</p>
<p>Start replicating ideas,<br />
Anything that is worth saying is worth saying is worth saying is worth saying…</p>
<p>Stop finding interest in things that don’t interest you,<br />
You are what you pretend to be.</p>
<p>Start by believing that no one is interested in anything you have to say;<br />
And then say it with conviction.</p>
<p>Stop pretending you believe in something if you cannot live through the results of believing in something – otherwise, no conflict will occur at all.</p>
<p>Start recognising that these peripheral thoughts are just that.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
