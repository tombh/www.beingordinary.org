<p>Meeting reconvened.</p>
<p>If not every moment,<br />
Then not at all,<br />
Then resistance for such high demands,<br />
Then recognition of recognition,<br />
And remembering remembrance.</p>
<p>Which can be thought about whenever the mood takes,<br />
Amongst, (that's a nice word), just amongst then.<br />
Meetings shall be renamed 'amongsts',<br />
But shall still require attendance.</p>
<p>If there is continued disagreement on this point,<br />
Definition of definition must be submitted by noon,<br />
It should be assumed that the deaf are listening,<br />
And that although uncertainty is certain,<br />
Certainty is most certainly not uncertain,<br />
Yes, the blind <em>can</em> see.</p>
<p>Here forth with,<br />
Approbation is given to preceding, current and pending documents,<br />
The warmest Season's Blessings to All,<br />
To creativity, inventiveness and originality (poems shall not be made to appear like other's!).<br />
With thanks, and hope that there's loads more to come.</p>
<p>Meeting re-adjourned.</p>
