<p>Take the cadavers shopping,<br />
In hope that the dead may understand our plight,<br />
Bring forth the corpses to parade our wars,<br />
Let them march our streets to witness our wares.</p>
<p>Let the dogs of hell loose upon our pets,<br />
To feast upon the bones we throw away,<br />
Like our guilt feasting upon our entrails…</p>
<p>But the breath runs coarse, the pointed finger grows old,<br />
The poems grow familiar and the mould grows richer,<br />
And the heart sinks into the pockets of those that remember<br />
And the bowels grow weaker and the veins sigh rougher<br />
And the darkness beckons brighter and the wind howls never<br />
And the poem sinks deeper and deeper into shallow waters<br />
And is washed up…</p>
<p>And you, the poor soul that reads this, knows that Plato might have been right:<br />
Exile the poets. What right have they to be wrong?</p>
