<p>It's bloody hard to write something original, if it's not 'there', it's not there.</p>
<p>But this is new! I've not talked about this before, in this way, on this day. Maybe I'll write something about what I'm up to at the moment, mmm, or maybe not, it's not that interesting, well it is, but not in a kind of poetical/philosophical type way.</p>
<p>I like saying stuff that's interesting, but maybe it's good not to try and be interesting all the time.</p>
