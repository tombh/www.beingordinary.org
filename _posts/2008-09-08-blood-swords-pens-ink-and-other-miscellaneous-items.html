<p>I should abandon this poem.<br />
I cannot complete it,<br />
Without stigma blotting the scraping knuckled<br />
Pavement of the red sky<br />
I tear away, wary that such<br />
Impossible battles will certainly<br />
Curtail the joints to ill measured means,<br />
Bandages covering the wrists, knees and ankles,<br />
Carefully watchful of the cancers and ulcers<br />
Creeping slowly into the recesses of the major organs,<br />
Ready to strike a chord rhyming majestically<br />
With angelic symphonies, eulogies and merry requiems<br />
Of the allergies washed awry from bygone eras... </p>
<p>Ears, dangling loose from the hidden cries of history,<br />
Thump erect at the thunder of distress,<br />
But the harmonies of the dead are muffled<br />
Beneath the rumblings of the topsoil<br />
Redistributed and cavitated with convenience and astroturf.</p>
<p>Ocean blue, Blood red or Black death to recollect these muses;<br />
Blood and ink and other such liquid are hardly comparable or interesting,<br />
Swords and pens are both simply flint;</p>
<p>Maybe the hope should be abandoned...<br />
Perhaps, love itself, too hard in a world so full of options;<br />
That which ten decades ago was offensive<br />
Can now be sold off in the millions.</p>
<p>Where is the industry built on love,<br />
But in the scribbles of the hopeful...?<br />
Peter's first church wasn't the first at all,<br />
Hope creates things to make sense,<br />
Hate helps the species survive.</p>
<p>I should've abandoned this poem,<br />
But the hope of another was too great.</p>
