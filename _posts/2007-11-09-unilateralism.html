<p>If you could have one last breath,<br />
What would you scream…</p>
<p>The deserts are clean,<br />
The mountains are pure,<br />
The rivers are veins,<br />
The heart is what you rip out and stomp<br />
Upon whenever the chance opportunes…</p>
<p>Geography can’t corrupt you<br />
Although it confutes us at every turn;<br />
Culture can’t define you<br />
Although it collides with every wave;<br />
Nature is the rock and the sea<br />
And they convince you; yet<br />
That until you battle your belated body upon<br />
Those rocks and currents that<br />
You’ve yet to tempt survival…</p>
<p>The luck of the young poet is to be unread –<br />
The poverty of the old poet is to be read<br />
And to have known the tide.</p>
<p>Pity yourself –<br />
I’ve other things to do.</p>
