<p>Sorry, really, i couldn't know...</p>
<p>If i took ownership of this and that, it wasn't because i was mean or arrogant... i thought it was like this that's all. I thought
<div><a href="http://viagratabletsed.com/">viagra for sale</a></div>
<p> this was mine and that was not mine. I even thought i had my own body, my own movements, my own thoughts, my own will and understanding. And thinking of myself as wealthy, really i had lost everything.</p>
<p>But now i don't need that, i don't want it anymore,  take it back. Don't tell me about your secrets, i don't need to understand, knowledge is too heavy for this little heart.</p>
<p>Just let me look at you ok?</p>
<p>Oh... am i doing it again?</p>
