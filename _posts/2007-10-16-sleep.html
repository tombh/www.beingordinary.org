<p>Someday the roughage of the daily diet is too much to bare.<br />
Oh how the boredom meets us with each breakfast,<br />
The mundainity greets us for lunch,<br />
And the loneliness berates us at our own dinner table.</p>
<p>All that I suggest is to be selfish for eight hours a day – in sleep.<br />
The rest is for the rest of us. To rest is not to be a rock,<br />
Reliable, unchanged, impregnable,<br />
But to wRESTle with the universe,<br />
In name, feature or form.</p>
<p>For sleep is but a hope to rise once again<br />
From the ashes and dust and soot and murk<br />
Of our eventual demise.</p>
<p>Dance the Danse Macabre with nimble limbs,<br />
Drink the strong wine when it flows,<br />
Follow no man or woman who demands it so,<br />
Agility and obligation are enemies of each other,<br />
Make peace with both.</p>
<p>Take comfort in your sleep – it will serve you better than your army.</p>
