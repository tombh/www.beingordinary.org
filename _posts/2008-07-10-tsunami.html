<p>Head clasped to the pavement,<br />
Misanthropic intent intact,<br />
The hum of the new roars past,<br />
Daily, in droves of drones,<br />
With phones a drear, tactile response<br />
To the hive of common's 'n' commin's and goin's<br />
Of days long hoped for and dreams of<br />
Gods lost ages ago in the days<br />
Where such things were known as<br />
Daily rituals; all things must pass.</p>
<p>The dirty sunken musk of the metropolis,<br />
Shall we be drawn inexorably into;<br />
The mother's web of oneness to a womb<br />
Of smog, smut and smite,<br />
'Tis God's will; and why not!<br />
The chains and knots that bind me are but<br />
Momentary incisions given the correct<br />
Sepulchre; our fathers would steal away<br />
The knives from our throats again<br />
For fear of divinity.</p>
<p>The hole in the whole is the bothered burden<br />
Of the contempt of the soil that lies<br />
Beneath the soul. The context, truth and possibility<br />
Lie above the surface, becoming more<br />
And more at each breath, each stretch beyond<br />
Every moment...</p>
<p>In the eye, I will awake.</p>
<p>Seeping the swept possibilities from each pore,<br />
I pour more or less the broom that eats<br />
The mass and the mess of my littered<br />
Petrie dish culture than I poke and pool my<br />
Strange little resources into.</p>
<p>The cripples walk in awe of such awkward,<br />
Strange epidemiology...</p>
<p>For fear that there is so little left of it...</p>
