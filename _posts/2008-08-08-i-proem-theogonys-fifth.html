<p>Not less the fecund impossibility<br />
That nethers and nights behind many dreams;<br />
Not less the crooked circularity<br />
That skies and violents to anchor broad Earth.</p>
<p>The fecund and the impossible<br />
But part of my primeval fertility;<br />
The crooked and the circular<br />
But part of my solitary amble.</p>
<p>Not more the tartan murk<br />
That locations in a different place;<br />
Not more the virgin mingle<br />
That brings and bears needlessly.</p>
<p>The bronzed deep and the imprisoned<br />
But part of my strange and my truth;<br />
The immaculate and frame conception<br />
But part of my desire and my tread.</p>
<p>Not less, not more<br />
But beyond is I,<br />
Magus, prophet and poet,<br />
The burning I,</p>
<p>Silent, unknown, here,<br />
But a solitary divine,</p>
<p>Chasms, worlds and dies,<br />
Ripping difference apart.</p>
