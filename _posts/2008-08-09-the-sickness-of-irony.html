<p>Blood on the currency.<br />
Mercury illuminates the contempt<br />
Of the industrious;<br />
Must the complacent be<br />
So retrograde to displace<br />
The many in favour of the few?</p>
<p>Why are we not at war already;<br />
The third world must know the spill of goods<br />
Is a schism;</p>
<p>The Behest of Africa at the table in<br />
Berlin 1884-5<br />
is to ignore the wounds carved upon<br />
the world still unfelt by the unfeeling<br />
or unknowing till this day will remain<br />
scattered like ashes upon our corpses<br />
to know that we did some, little<br />
or nothing -</p>
<p>Freedom must be an unfinished business<br />
In a world bursting at the seems<br />
With famine, misery and terror at the behest of<br />
The family, miserly and territorial;</p>
<p>What heart can ignore such horrors<br />
Is perhaps a beauteous, bountiful and loving heart;<br />
But not a whole heart...</p>
<p>...The mind...<br />
Never mind the mind,<br />
It didn't know itself then,<br />
Why should it know itself now?</p>
