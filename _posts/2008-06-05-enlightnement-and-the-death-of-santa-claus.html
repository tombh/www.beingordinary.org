<p>This is our first podcast for the site, we hope the first of many. We're hoping to get everyone recorded, but this one is just between Ben, Tom and Mike. The initial question was something along the lines of, "Is the path to enlightenment sudden or gradual?" The ending is a bit 'sudden' if you'll pardon the pun because the computer crashed whilst ending and we lost some data, not to worry it still contains the main guts of our conversation.</p>
