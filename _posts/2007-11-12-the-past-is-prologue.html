<p>I remember the highs, the lows, the pits, traps and woes,<br />
I recall the seas, the tide, the sand, the breeze,<br />
And I forget the times, the falls, the rise,<br />
The histories, the memories, the disguiseâ€¦</p>
<p>And it all falls back to the now,<br />
The who, the what, when and how;<br />
That despite the world I know that falls into decay,<br />
Produces another tomorrow, that falls into today.</p>
