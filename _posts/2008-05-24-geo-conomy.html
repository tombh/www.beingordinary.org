<p>The breadth and depth of the earth should and can<br />
Be measured by the breadth of its understanding<br />
Of its possible derth, the length of its resources and the<br />
Impossibility of its existence to do such a thing.</p>
<p>These words fall on deaf ears now,<br />
For I cannot muster the dedication.<br />
It's me. It is my name. You won't read me<br />
For I have no name. There is no gain.<br />
The poem is dead. The purpose is dead.<br />
It brings no relief. The whole thing brings no relief.</p>
<p>I know how to change everything.<br />
Just ask. </p>
<p>Even morons have answers.</p>
