<p>Chaos and order.<br />
Left and right.<br />
It’s already starting to sound moral.<br />
There’s a message there,<br />
somewhere;<br />
a tangible truth.<br />
A meaning.<br />
A reason. </p>
<p>North and south.<br />
Odds and evens.<br />
Opposites attract.<br />
Smoking kills.<br />
There’s a message.<br />
Proof.<br />
An abstract goal.<br />
Some discernible truth,<br />
maybe.<br />
Perhaps.<br />
Occasionally.<br />
Search and find.<br />
Repeat and fade. </p>
