<p>Lose the faith you've mustered together<br />
The temptation to throw it in is a myth<br />
Severe that limb that hold you to the trappings of your words<br />
Crew off that nasty promise<br />
Why keep your word in the face of so many words?<br />
So many promises?<br />
So many contradictory deeds and actions<br />
Why even bother to pretend that each breath you speak isn't a lie?<br />
Oh, to be heard again - to have ears that wait upon the breath that speaks...<br />
Any ear will do...<br />
But we live in an age of mutes who speak.<br />
The baby who screams loudest will get the most attention.</p>
