<p>Â </p>
<p>Reflections of nothing</p>
<p>Must look like something</p>
<p>If the law of opposites is to be believed.</p>
<p>In which case I am always nowhere,</p>
<p>Yet, craftily,</p>
<p>I clothe myself in mountains and stars,</p>
<p>As a desolate drunk, stubborn in self-loathing,</p>
<p>As a smiling child, waiting for the next hee-hee-hee.</p>
