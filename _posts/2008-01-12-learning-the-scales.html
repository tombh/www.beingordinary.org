<p>I should have been a masseuse,<br />
Giddy at the joy of ripping into a new spine each session,<br />
Fingers all eight like teams of surgeons correcting postures<br />
Held at ransom to the worlds terrors,<br />
Thumbs all a kibble searching endlessly for holes, relief and pleasures<br />
Lying forgotten in the knots and wounds of each poor soul<br />
Who instructs me for their wares.<br />
Instead, I just thought about it.</p>
<p>I should have been a musician,<br />
Giddy at the joy of ringing virtues out in chords and chimes,<br />
Beating hearts and feet with my drums and bells,<br />
Belting verse/chorus/verse praising and dismissing<br />
The opportunity to be alive,<br />
Placing reels of tape into the record of thoughts that<br />
Deserve a place in history for their humble praise of humility…<br />
Instead, I just thought about it.</p>
<p>I should have been a monk,<br />
Giddy at the joy of spending hour upon hour praising the universe,<br />
Blessing each thought and word and action towards things larger than myself<br />
Quietly ignoring the potency of satisfaction from material pleasures,<br />
Dedicating a life towards something greater than myself,<br />
Writing endlessly towards the benefit of the world…<br />
Instead, I just thought about it.</p>
<p>I should have been an actor,<br />
Giddy at the joy of soothing myself piece by piece into another existence,<br />
Ready at the slightest command to become at the moment required,<br />
To live by the second and produce with immediacy a Foreign God,<br />
A saber-toothed tiger, an ancient peasant or something not yet imagined…<br />
Instead, I just thought about it.</p>
<p>I wanted to be all of them and more,<br />
Giddy at the joy of knowing that I could be,<br />
Untainted by the achievements of the greatest,<br />
Disconcerted by the imagined greatness of the skeptics,<br />
Undaunted by the tasks yet to be achieved…<br />
Instead of worrying about it,<br />
I just did it.   </p>
