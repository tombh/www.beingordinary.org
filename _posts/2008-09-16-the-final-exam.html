<p>Here is a rather striking, yet moving wedding blessing. Though intended for a marriage ceremony its resonance is certainly broader;</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Link to Wiesel's Wikipedia entry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel" target="_blank">Elie Wiesel</a> wrote, "If to be free is the most important goal of all, then to help someone be or become free must be the most sublime and rewarding of human endeavours."</p>
<p>I wish you deep sustaining love for each other, but as rare as authentic love is, helping someone to be or become free is even rarer. If you make such mutual help the organising principal of your life together, then authentic love and all other goodness will flow and purify between you as a natural result.</p>
<p>The final exam of  your helping each other to be or become free is likely to be losing each other. As surely as this wedding joins you, death or estrangement will part you. I hope that you will never take for granted that which can not be taken for granted. If you know in your hearts everyday that you will lose each other, then you can cut away attachment with the fierce courage of the fox that chews off its own leg to free itself from the trap. If you know for certain this approaching loss, perhaps everyday you can thank each other for the invaluable gift of that day together. Perhaps this knowing will help you to live gratefully and urgently together in the present moment. And perhaps dwelling deeply in the present will even allow you to see that separation is only illusion, that no loss is possible, and that you are bringing each other home.</p></blockquote>
<p>This blessing was written by Eric Kolvig and was publicly recited by him at the end of a<a href="http://www.audiodharma.org/teacher/91/talk/47/20010910-Eric_Kolvig-IMC-wisdom.mp3"> talk entitled "Wisdom" given at the Insight Meditation Centre in Redwood, California on 10th of Spetember 2001</a>.</p>
