<p>A tough muscle, the heart...<br />
A bully, really, in philosophical jargon;<br />
Brains, balls, hearts, lungs, feet and hands...<br />
And the surmountable rest weighs in about 74kg.</p>
<p>Not a disappointing weight, by all accounts -<br />
One should at least take the time to weigh correctly,<br />
Normal is preferable to its counterpart,<br />
By most accounts again.</p>
<p>And then the sickness comes...</p>
<p>Everything is fine but me,<br />
Any measure to remove the pain<br />
Is compared indifferently to all other ills,<br />
Put me to rest and let the rest of the world grow still.</p>
<p>Stop the world I want to get off.</p>
<p>No offence required, no defence necessitated,<br />
The sickness is already here,<br />
The rats and cockroaches are awry,<br />
A little army of death,<br />
Worms and ammonia awaiting,<br />
Sharp teeth, mild temperament and opposable digits<br />
No match for regeneration, cellular mutation and patience;</p>
<p>The sickness is here, ready or not;<br />
Whatever doesn't kill you will cause you cancer...<br />
Madness is a blessing begotten of poets and philologists;<br />
And anyone else who could muster the effort.</p>
