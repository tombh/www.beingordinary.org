<p>The predictable onset immerses the subject in a subjective experience of feeling numbness, coldness or general hopelessness. The beauty of this condition allows the sufferer to experience these emotions without distraction; although the result is necessarily observed as ‘difference’. The sufferer usually will produce various results from such a syndrome – tears, excrement, bile; which they generally choose to use socially acceptable methods of diminishing their plight – usually tobacco and alcohol related produce. Other symtomps include desperate behavior, indifference to life, loss of appetite, poor appearance and poetry. </p>
