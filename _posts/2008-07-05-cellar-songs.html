<p align="center">When we were alone I sang my sacred songs with gusto,</p>
<p align="center">by the boom of a subterranean piano;</p>
<p align="center">agonising, kicking at the wood with my silk shoes</p>
<p align="center">and crooning while you played</p>
<p align="center">against my ribs, gently sawing at the cracked white ribbons</p>
<p align="center">binding everything. How it all spilled,</p>
<p align="center">like thoughts from heads, away</p>
<p align="center">into the treacherous, mad clash of living.</p>
<p align="center">We were gadabouts in death's river,</p>
<p align="center">all excellence and curiosity,</p>
<p align="center">muted silliness and burgeoning love. I accepted</p>
<p align="center">your sumptuous wine with bravado,</p>
<p align="center">knowing the must of it,</p>
<p align="center">and that was all there was.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Now I am grown barefoot, it is Summer:</p>
<p align="center">a blue square in a dark wall.</p>
<p align="center">My humming is a vague, sweeping tail.</p>
<p align="center">I have crushed the spices and pummelled the bread.</p>
<p align="center">It has all been put to one side,</p>
<p align="center">to rise quietly and prove itself.</p>
<p align="center">I am still; the space beneath my feet is black as the cellar</p>
<p align="center">into which we once sprang feet first</p>
<p align="center"> to face the dead, the unholy,</p>
<p align="center">mystical force of them.</p>
<p align="center">But even now, they are not quiet: they slop their wine and whoop;</p>
<p align="center">they roar and pound their pianos, and I desire them,</p>
<p align="center">chorusing inharmoniously their many, varied endings.</p>
<p align="center">The unliving and the unlived: stubbornly resisting the cement I pour and pour.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
