<p>The idea of the machine gives more and more an idea of ourselves than what we recognise. Fundamentally, the machine/engine is much more reliable than our ability to 'be' ourselves. Much of our dialogue here is a search for what 'is'. I watched Ben's contribution on Scott Kiloby's vid-blog (or whatever its referred to as) with complete disinterest. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because stillness isn't anymore enlightening than movement. </p>
<p>Stillness of mind and movement doesn't prevent the moment. You still 'are' independently of whether you realise it or not - and if that is the case, why is it so imperative that we achieve stillness? To be disaffected? What's so troublesome about being affected? Isn't stillness an affectation? I don't mind being troubled by things - politics and ethics are Hindu, Buddhist and Taoist principles, as are the Greek, Roman and Christian logicians of our own civilisation. </p>
<p>If the good is stillness, then Buddhism renounces teaching... which of course it doesn't; its entire tendancy is toward expansion. Expansion through stillness. </p>
<p>My ultimate question (beyond all of the half-assed derivatives that would probably offened about a billion people if they read it) is "what is the good?" If we cannot agree upon a 'natural' human being (one that is still, moving, thinking, doing, fucking, producing), then what should we agree upon? Justice? God/s? Education?</p>
<p>Moreover, what is 'our' nature?</p>
<p>For I fear the machine is what we actually admire most about ourselves. </p>
<p>I'll stop there, with a postscript below.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>This post was one of many that I tried to start but felt that I couldn't; having re-visited the initial post, I felt compelled. It was as follows:</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely in constant fear of writing. I recently mapped my own metaphorical cartesian plain of my fears and achievements, in which I had to in turn also project my mathematical interpretation of social expectation of the reception of myself."</p>
