<p>1</p>
<p>Child-steps levelling grass flat tread,<br />
Crushing majority, flattening worlds of Up.</p>
<p>From bottom of hill,<br />
Child’s steps stomp destruction, passage crunching and grinding,<br />
Returning spears of green forcefully, blindly, to the dirt and flat.</p>
<p>Flesh-feet uncaring talk murder to vegetable fingers,<br />
Returning wind-hazed rovings to featureless Down.</p>
<p>Summer spears yodelling vertical in vain,<br />
Breaking horizontal with child walking.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Minority pours minute, folding sideways, spilling cardinal and free,<br />
Touched by crisp-laced boot and pointing worlds of Up.</p>
<p>From bottom of hill,<br />
Child’s shadow lengths symbiotic, passing with shades of feeling, <br />
Shadow-lain flat, black and lifeless without yodels of untrodden grass.</p>
<p>Ghost-feet caring talk welcome to midnighted fingers,<br />
Mingling light-dark caresses on textured Up.</p>
<p>Drifting and flitting bundled-black hair, grass melds human,<br />
Ribboning vertical with wight talking.</p>
