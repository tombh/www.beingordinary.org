<p>Since Mike introduced me to the notion of "advaita" and authors like Parsons, confusion has been dominating my mind. (Thanks Mike :P)</p>
<p>Nisargadatta, Parsons, whoever i have read about or heard about only added to the confusion. What seemed so simple and obvious once had now become an obscure enigma, a huge question mark. Well it's not this bad after all, it means that this so called liberation had not fully been realised.</p>
<p>Then i found this guy called Scott Kiloby who manages to share liberation with words without creating this frustration in the mind. I <u><a href="http://buycialisonline-khui.com/">buy cialis online</a> just like it and would like to share it with you with this little video asking<a href="http://www.kiloby.com/whoareyou.wmv" title="Who Are You?"> "Who Are You?"</a></p>
<p>You will find more on www.kiloby.com</p>
<p>Enjoy :)</u></p>
