<p>This time we're drawing on our roots in academia and religious studies and asking whether or not it's possible to study the ineffable? Thanks to Keith Nightingale ( a real life Ho-tai) for letting use his title. Music from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/whattheanimalssay" target="_blank">Whatthe Animalssay</a> a kind of lap-top recording, globe-trotting, troubadour.  It would be great to get some feedback on this topic as its close to our hearts. Feel free to comment and question below.</p>
