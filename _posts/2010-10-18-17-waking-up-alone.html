<p>Tom and Mike discuss what it's like to wake up to what you are in modern Western culture. Thanks to<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Whatthe-Animalssay/116147154335" target="_blank"> Whatthe Animalssay</a> for his song 'Bears Will Eat Their Young'. Comments and questions welcome below :-)</p>
