<p>The Philosopher Kings live happily beneith the world,<br />
Now dead enjoying the fruits of their labours,<br />
Atlantis their wondrous paradise beneith the waves,<br />
Until the heavens are revealed to us though Galileo's wonderment:<br />
Sight beyond sight - the heavens revealed, the Earth discovered again,<br />
Beauty alligned the first time again, the world renewed...</p>
<p>And I still sit, amazed as one should be for all that there is,<br />
Amazed by the universe and the most important thing in it -<br />
My love.</p>
<p>Love in the vacuum - the gravity, the force that draws us<br />
Towards the greatest of ourselves. </p>
<p>That which is missing is always present,<br />
And that which is absent is always near.</p>
