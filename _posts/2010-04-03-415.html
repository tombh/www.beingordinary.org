<p>This week we're talking about death and emptiness.Â What is it that dies? And just what are we so afraid of? We'd love to open this conversation up so feel free to post comments and questions below. Thanks to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rob-Suso/370471502180?ref=ts" target="_blank">Rob Suso</a> for the music.</p>
