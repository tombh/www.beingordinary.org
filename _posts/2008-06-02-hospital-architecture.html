<p>What an amazing view to die from<br />
He said as he gazed through the mists of fog<br />
Upon the town that metropolised<br />
Before he knew to count the years that passed between the transition.</p>
<p>He'd seen his kids grow sporadically through the visits<br />
That reminded him occasionally that he wasn't getting any younger<br />
But that life insurance was sorely needed as<br />
The realm of inevitability was slowly creeping...</p>
<p>Max didn't think it was any great importance that his life didn't flash before him,<br />
He was tired of things moving and was much more content with<br />
A slow death, as a quick death would have just felt weird -<br />
"I went through all that for something so quick?"</p>
<p>His bone marrow was the issue, apparently. So the physician said.<br />
He'd never smoked, but somehow wished that he may have.<br />
It was his mother's fault, he mused, she'd always thought it might kill him.<br />
He figured something had to fail him eventually - it might has well be the temple.</p>
<p>"Foundations..." he pondered. "My foundations are failing me."<br />
"The structure that is holding me together is failing me."<br />
I have a strong will, clever brain, nobel heart, watertight lungs,<br />
No salt can overcome my kidneys, no booze tought enough to fail my liver,<br />
No tumour, typhoid, cancer, arthridis, memory loss;<br />
No broken heart, no insolvent will, no cavity too great, no slowness of breath...<br />
No ulcers, no pancreatic, no pathos no knowing what else other than </p>
<p>The temple itself - it just cannot sustain all of the good within it. </p>
<p>But it is at least a wonderful view.</p>
<p>Maximillian Plainview 1944-2008.</p>
