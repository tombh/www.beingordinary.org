<p>Question the ground that you walk upon,<br />
What is it made from, who made it?<br />
Question the stone that your comfort is built of,<br />
Is it stone brick mansonry or other...<br />
Question the table that you eat from,<br />
The hands that brought the food to the hands that prepared it...<br />
Then, and only then question which ideology or God produced it.</p>
<p>The same sun provides for all - the coldness of Pluto, dwarf it may be,<br />
The radiant brilliance of Mercury, the heat of Venus,<br />
The anger of Mars and the brilliance of the other orbs,<br />
Leave us stupified to the petty carvings of land that we possess,<br />
The silly contracts the bonds and stocks we use to understand our ideas,<br />
It all floats and flows in accordance with worlds we cannot possibly try to identify,</p>
<p>So if you try, and as you should do, make it stick -<br />
High ideals have a way of making things fall.<br />
Good ideas should be for the all. </p>
