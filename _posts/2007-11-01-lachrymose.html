<p>So poetry it is - to scream at the stars but affection beckons,<br />
The mistress lay her head upon my lap and I muse no more,<br />
The heavens dream of such blissful delight,<br />
Screaming,<br />
Bring back the impossibility of love,<br />
For it should be for the father,<br />
Our god,<br />
But my lap cried out to the heavens,<br />
I shan't move a muscle in my body,<br />
Bid she might move away,<br />
And for you dear angels to have one more dialogue with me...</p>
