<p>Alan Chapman co-runs a website, with Duncan Barford, called <a href="http://openenlightenment.org/" target="_blank">Open Enlightenment</a>, a website that is, in their own words, "dedicated to the honest and down-to-earth discussion of the very real and natural human phenomenon known as enlightenment." I met up with Alan at his home in London to discuss the nitty-gritty of life, the universe and everything. Thanks to <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sigur Rós</a> for their generous permission to use their beautiful track starálfur.</p>
