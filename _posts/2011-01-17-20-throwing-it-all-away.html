<p>So, you're Enlightened, Awakened, you've had incredible insights and mind-blowing mystical experiences. Great. Now what if you were to throw all these experiences away? This month Tom and I discuss what it means to be liberated even from the very idea of 'Enlightenment'. As always, comments and questions are most welcome.</p>
