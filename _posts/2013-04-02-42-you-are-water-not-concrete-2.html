<p>Hello Everyone! It's been a while. Tom's busy training to be a Psychotherapist in Bristol and Mike's teaching Mindfulness on the Isle of Man. We caught up last week to talk about the value of spiritual experiences and the pitfalls of grasping them as 'true'. We hope you enjoy the conversation, it'd be great to hear what you think.</p>
