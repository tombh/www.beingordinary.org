<p>Winter is upon us, dear friends,<br />
The unhappy microbes of ailment<br />
Shall taunt out weary souls;<br />
But our spirits will beset any weather,<br />
Whether we continue to care,<br />
About our wereabouts;<br />
The jig and merry dance<br />
Will always remind us of our locale -<br />
We spin and spin and ne'er shall have<br />
Eyes to see behind us;<br />
We listen and shout and ne'er shall have<br />
Ears to enlighten us;<br />
We lick, moan, taste, tempt and knaw upon<br />
The feast of our species' magnificent scents;<br />
But we still spin and spin until we spin no more,<br />
The weave unfinite, the failure in awe.</p>
